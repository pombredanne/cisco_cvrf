# Cisco Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs)
This is a repository by [Omar Santos](https://omarsantos.io) that includes Cisco security vulnerabilities in [CVRF](http://csaf.io) format. The CVRF files in this repository were obtained automatically by custom scripts created by Omar using the [Cisco PSIRT openVuln API](https://developer.cisco.com/psirt/).

## What is Cisco PSIRT?
The [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT)](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#dsvdpcsd) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and networks. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as an unintended weakness in a product that could allow an attacker to compromise the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of the product. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2014

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability
Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to [contact the Cisco PSIRT](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#roosfassv). Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. The minimal data needed for reporting a security issue is a description of the potential vulnerability.

Additional information about the Cisco disclosure process can be found at [Cisco's Security Vulnerability Policy](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html).
