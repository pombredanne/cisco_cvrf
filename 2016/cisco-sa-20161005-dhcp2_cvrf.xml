    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the implementation of the DHCPv4 relay agent in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.



The vulnerability is due to improper validation of malformed DHCPv4 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed DHCPv4 packets to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the DHCP process or device to crash.




This vulnerability can be exploited using IPv4 packets only. The vulnerability can be triggered by malformed DHCP packets processed by a DHCP relay agent listening on the device, using the IPv4 broadcast address or IPv4 unicast address of any interface configured on a device.





Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. 



This advisory is available at the following link:

http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-dhcp2["https://tvce.cisco.com/security/AIMS/http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-dhcp2"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following Cisco products are vulnerable if they are running Cisco NX-OS System Software that is configured for DHCP:


    Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders
    Nexus 3000 Series Switches
    Nexus 3500 Platform Switches
    Nexus 5000 Series Switches
    Nexus 5500 Platform Switches
    Nexus 5600 Platform Switches
    Nexus 6000 Series Switches
    Nexus 7000 Series Switches
    Nexus 7700 Series Switches
    Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode
    Nexus 9000 Series Switches in NX-OS mode

This vulnerability affects only devices configured with the DHCPv4 process enabled and configured as a DHCPv4 relay agent.



To determine whether a Cisco Nexus device running a vulnerable version of Cisco NX-OS Software is configured as a DHCPv4 relay agent, administrators can use the show running | include dhcp command from the Cisco NX-OS command-line interface (CLI) and verify that the feature is enabled.



The following example shows that the DHCP relay feature is enabled on a device running Cisco NX-OS Software that is configured to relay DHCP requests to a DHCP server with the IPv4 address 192.168.0.1:



# show running | include dhcp
feature dhcp 
ip dhcp relay 
ip dhcp relay address 192.168.0.1

To determine whether a vulnerable version is running on a Cisco NX-OS device, administrators can use the show version command from the NX-OS CLI. The following example shows the results for a Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switch running Cisco NX-OS Software version 5.2(1)N1(1b):

</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.



The following products are not affected by this vulnerability:


    Multilayer Director Switches
    Nexus 1000V Series Switches
    Nexus 4000 Series Switches
    Unified Computing System (UCS) 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects

</Note>
    <Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Exploitation of this vulnerability will cause the affected device to reload and generate a DHCP process core file. Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to review  the core file and determine whether the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"].



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"].



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.



Fixed Releases



Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the applicable table in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:
