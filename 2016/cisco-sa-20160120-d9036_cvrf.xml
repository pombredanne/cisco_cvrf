    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Modular Encoding Platform D9036 Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to the system shell with the privileges of the root user. 

 

The vulnerability occurs because the root user has a default and static password. This account is created at installation and cannot be changed or deleted without impacting the functionality of the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by remotely connecting to the affected system via SSH using this account. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to access the system with the privileges of the root user.



In addition to the root user, the guest user account also has a default and
static password. The guest account is created at installation and cannot be
changed or deleted without impacting the functionality of the system. However,
this account has limited privileges on the system.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.




This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160120-d9036["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160120-d9036"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects any products running Cisco Modular Encoding Platform D9036 Software prior to release version 02.04.70.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Workarounds are not available.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.



Fixed Versions



This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Modular Encoding Platform D9036 Software release versions 02.04.70 and later. 




Additional Important Information




The upgrade procedure will not reset the default password for the root or the guest user; however, the system will be able to change the password. Customers upgrading to release version 02.04.70 should use the following procedure to change the password for the root and guest users:


    
    Log in to the system using root as the username and root as the password
    
    To change the root user password, use the set-root-password command and input the new password 
    
    To change the guest user password, use the set-guest-password command and input the new password
