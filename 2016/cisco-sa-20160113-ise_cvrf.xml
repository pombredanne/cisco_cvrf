Customers are advised to apply a patch or upgrade to a version of Cisco ISE software that resolves this vulnerability.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.



There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. 



This advisory is available at the following link:

http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160113-ise["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160113-ise"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco ISE devices running software versions 1.1 or later, 1.2.0 prior to patch 17, 1.2.1 prior to patch 8, 1.3 prior to patch 5, or 1.4 prior to patch 4 are vulnerable.



To determine which version of the software is currently running on a device, administrators may use the show version command in the device command-line interface (CLI) or click on the hostname in the upper-right corner of the Admin portal.
