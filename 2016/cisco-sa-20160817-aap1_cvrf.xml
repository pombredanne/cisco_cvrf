    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in command execution from the command line-interface (CLI) of Cisco Access Point (AP) platforms could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform privilege escalation to root-level privileges.



The vulnerability occurs because user input is not properly sanitized for certain commands at the CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device, crafting user input parameters for certain commands, and executing the command at the CLI. An exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to the root level.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
