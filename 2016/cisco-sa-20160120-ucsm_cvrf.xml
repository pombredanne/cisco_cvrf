    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in a CGI script in the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Manager and the Cisco Firepower 9000 Series appliance could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Cisco UCS Manager or the Cisco Firepower 9000 Series appliance.

The vulnerability is due to unprotected calling of shell commands in the CGI script. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the Cisco UCS Manager or the Cisco Firepower 9000 Series appliance. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Cisco UCS Manager or the Cisco Firepower 9000 Series appliance.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160120-ucsm ["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160120-ucsm"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability was introduced in version 2.2.0 of Cisco UCS Manager. Versions 2.2.x are affected if they are earlier than the first fixed release indicated in the "Fixed Software" section of this advisory.  This vulnerability does not affect versions 2.1.x and earlier.

    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Workarounds are not available.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html
 ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]
Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt ["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
