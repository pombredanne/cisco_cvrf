    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the kernel logging configuration for Firepower System Software for the Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5585-X FirePOWER Security Services Processor (SSP) module could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to high consumption of system resources. 



The vulnerability is due to the logging of certain IP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of specially crafted IP packets to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco FirePOWER module to cease inspecting traffic or go offline.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.




This advisory is available at the following link:



http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160504-fpkern["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160504-fpkern"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">All versions of Firepower System Software for the ASA 5585-X FirePOWER SSP modules are affected by this vulnerability. The vulnerability does not depend on the software configuration.



Determining the ASA 5585-X FirePOWER SSP Software Version



To determine the running version, issue the show version command from the command-line interface, which an administrator can access via the serial console, an SSH session to the management interface, or a session opened from the parent ASA 5585-X FirePOWER SSP module using the session command. 



The following example shows Firepower System Software version 5.4.0:

&gt; show version

---------[ asasfr ]----------

Model                     : ASA5585 (72) Version 5.4.0 (Build 763)

UUID                      : 1401763c-a7a5-11e4-9cfd-92a5551c2e4f

VDB version               : 225

----------------------------------------------------
Customers using FireSIGHT Management Center to manage the ASA 5585-X FirePOWER SSP module can locate the version of ASA 5500-X Series software with FirePOWER Services module by navigating to Devices &gt; Device Management and double-clicking the device name.

    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"].



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"].



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
