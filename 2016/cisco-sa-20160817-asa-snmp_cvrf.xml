  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) code of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code.



The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the affected code area. The vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP (versions 1, 2c, and 3) when enabled on a virtual or physical Cisco ASA device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SNMP packets to an SNMP-enabled interface on the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system or to cause a reload of the affected system. The attacker must know the SNMP community string to exploit this vulnerability.



Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects systems configured in routed and transparent firewall mode only and in single or multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 traffic only. The attacker requires knowledge of the configured SNMP community string in SNMP version 1 and SNMP version 2c or a valid username and password for SNMP version 3.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Mitigations are listed in the Workarounds section of this advisory.



This advisory is available at the following link:

http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160817-asa-snmp["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160817-asa-snmp"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco ASA Software running on the following products may be affected by this vulnerability:


    Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances
    Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls
    Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers
    Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall
    Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)
    Cisco Firepower 4100 Series
    Cisco Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module
    Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software
    Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM)*
    Cisco Industrial Security Appliance 3000 
    Cisco PIX Firewalls*

All versions of SNMP are affected by this vulnerability. Refer to the Fixed Software section of this security advisory for more information about the affected releases.



* Note: Cisco Firewall Service Modules and Cisco PIX Firewalls have passed the last day of software support milestone as stated in the published End of Life (EoL) documents. Further investigations into these devices will not be performed, and fixed software will not be made available. Please see the following EoL documents for further information:


    Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM)

</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have SNMP access and to monitor affected systems using the snmp-server host command.



The SNMP["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa96/configuration/general/asa-96-general-config/monitor-snmp.html"] chapter of the Cisco ASA Series General Operations CLI Configuration Guide explains how SNMP is configured in the Cisco ASA.



The attacker must know the community strings to successfully launch an attack against an affected device. Community strings are passwords that are applied to an ASA device to restrict both read-only and read-write access to the SNMP data on the device. These community strings, as with all passwords, should be carefully chosen to ensure they are not trivial. Community strings should be changed at regular intervals and in accordance with network security policies. For example, the strings should be changed when a network administrator changes roles or leaves the company.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
