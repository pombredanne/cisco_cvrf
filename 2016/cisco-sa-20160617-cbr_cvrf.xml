    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS XE Software running on Cisco cBR-8 Series Converged Broadband Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

 

The vulnerability exists because the affected platform does not properly trap SNMP read requests for a specific object ID that is not supported by the platform. When such a request is processed, the SNMP process may attempt to reference a pointer with a NULL value. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker who can authenticate to an affected device may submit a specific, valid SNMP request. A successful exploit will cause the supervisor card that serviced the request to restart, due to an attempt to access an invalid memory region, and result in a DoS condition.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
