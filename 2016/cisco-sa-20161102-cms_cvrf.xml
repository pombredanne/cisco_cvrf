    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Meeting Server and Meeting App could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.



The vulnerability exists because the software does not perform sufficient boundary checks on user-supplied data. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv6 input to the vulnerable function. A successful exploit could result in an exploitable buffer underflow condition. An attacker could leverage this buffer underflow condition to incorrectly allocate memory and cause a reload of the device or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected application.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.



This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161102-cms["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161102-cms"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco Meeting Server and Meeting App incorporate video, audio, and content-sharing capabilities into software that can be accessed via a conference room, desktop, or mobile device. Cisco Meeting Server and Meeting App work across Cisco video rooms and connect with Skype for Business and other providers to enable a seamless meeting architecture. This capability exists via collaboration between Cisco and Acano, who joined Cisco in early 2016.
</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">This vulnerability affects the following products:


    Cisco Meeting Server releases prior to 2.0.1
    Acano Server releases prior to 1.8.16 and prior to 1.9.3
    Cisco Meeting App releases prior to 1.9.8
    Acano Meeting Apps releases prior to 1.8.35

Administrators can check the system configuration from the command line interface (CLI) of the Cisco Meeting Server to determine if a device is affected. An administrator can determine the software version by using the version command.



For example, the following command output shows the version of a device running software version 2.0.6:

    system&gt; version
    2_0_6

Meeting Server software releases prior to 2.0 are available via Acano's website at https://www.acano.com/support/downloads["https://www.acano.com/support/downloads"].

    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"].



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x"] page, to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]. Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
