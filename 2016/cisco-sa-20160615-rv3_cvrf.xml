    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewalls, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Routers, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow on a targeted system, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input for fields in HTTP requests that are sent when a user configures an affected device by using the web-based management interface for the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an HTTP request that contains configuration commands with a crafted payload. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow on the targeted system, which could cause the device to reload unexpectedly and result in a DoS condition.



Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link:



http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160615-rv3["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160615-rv3"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">All releases of the following Cisco products are affected by this vulnerability:


    RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall
    RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router
    RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router

The web-based management interface is available for these devices via a local LAN connection or the remote management feature. By default, the remote management feature is disabled for the affected devices.



To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled for a device, open the web-based management interface for the device and then choose Basic Settings &gt; Remote Management. If the Enable check box is checked, remote management is enabled for the device.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco provides information about fixed software in Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"]. 



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerability Policy" Type="General" Ordinal="6">To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the Security Vulnerability Policy["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/psirt/security_vulnerability_policy.html"].
