    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco IOS on Catalysts Switches and Nexus 9300 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Layer 2 network storm.



The vulnerability occurs because the software forwards Layer 2 frames that should be consumed by the first hop. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting the Layer 2 frame into the network segment. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a Layer 2 network storm and impact the availability of the switches.



There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.
