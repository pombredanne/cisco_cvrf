    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Docker Engine configuration of Cisco CloudCenter
Orchestrator (CCO; formerly CliQr)  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to install Docker containers with high privileges on the affected system.



The
vulnerability is due to a misconfiguration that causes the Docker Engine management port to be reachable outside of the CloudCenter
Orchestrator system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
loading Docker containers on the affected system with arbitrary
privileges. As a secondary impact this may allow the attacker to gain root
privileges on the affected CloudCenter Orchestrator.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.
This advisory is available at the following link:

https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161221-cco["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161221-cco"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affect all releases of Cisco CloudCenter Orchestrator (CCO) deployments where the Docker Engine TCP port 2375 is open on the system and bound to local address 0.0.0.0 (any interface).



Administrator can log in to the CCO and issue the netstat -ant | grep 2375 command to determine if the port is open and bound to 0.0.0.0 local address.



The following example shows a CCO device with port 2375 in listening state and on local address 0.0.0.0


[root@cco ~]# netstat -ant | grep 2375
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)  
tcp        0      0  0.0.0.0:2375           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN  
TCP port 2375 is open by default with local address 0.0.0.0.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Administrator may be able to detect a malicious Docker container by listing all the install containers on the system using the docker images command.

The following example shows a list of containers which include a malicious container called badcontainer:


[root@cco ~]#docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
badcontainer        latest              aaaaaaaaaaaa        1 day ago           128.1 MB
cliqr/worker        latest              8b5213eb3fa2        2 weeks ago         643.9 MB
[...]

Because this vulnerability may allow access to the Cisco CCO software with root privileges, additional indicator of compromise may be present depending on the goal of the malicious actor.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Administrators can restrict the Docker Engine port to bind to localhost (127.0.0.1) following the procedure below:




    Issue the su command to obtain sudo privileges
    Enter the system directory using the following command cd /etc/systemd/system/
    Edit the docker.socket file with your chosen editor and change the ListenStream value to the following:
    
    ListenStream=127.0.0.1:2375
    

    
    Reload with the systemctl daemon-reload &amp;&amp; systemctl restart docker command

In addition, administrators can use the cloud provider security group or external firewall devices in private cloud deployment to restrict access to the CCO Docker Engine management port as per product documentation:

http://docs.cliqr.com/display/CCD46/Phase+2%3A+Configure+Network+Rules["http://docs.cliqr.com/display/CCD46/Phase+2%3A+Configure+Network+Rules"]
</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:


http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]


Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts 

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Fixed Releases 

This vulnerability has been fixed in the Cisco  CloudCenter Orchestrator 4.6.2 patch release.
