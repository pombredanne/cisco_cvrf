    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in XML parser code of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause system instability or a reload of the affected system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient hardening of the XML parser configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability in multiple ways by utilizing a malicious file. An attacker with administrative privileges could exploit this by uploading a malicious XML file on the system and trigger the XML code to parse the malicious file. Additionally, an attacker with Clienteles SSL VPN access could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted XML file. An exploit would allow the attacker to crash the XML parser process, which could cause system instability, memory exhaustion, and in some cases lead to a reload of the affected system.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.



This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160517-asa-xml["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160517-asa-xml"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">If the attacker has administrative privileges, the exposure does not depend on the actual configuration.



In the scenario where the attacker has access to a Clientless SSL VPN session, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance software is vulnerable if the Clientless SSL VPN feature and File Access (also known as Browse Networks) via Common Internet File System (CIFS) or FTP is allowed.</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">All Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance releases are affected by this vulnerability</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Workarounds are not available.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following table.



In the table, the left column lists major releases of Cisco ASA Software. The right column indicates whether a major release is
affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.
