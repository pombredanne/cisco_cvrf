    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Intelligence Center (CUIC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against the user of the web interface.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the web browser with the privileges of the user.



Additional information about CSRF attacks and potential mitigations can be found at:
