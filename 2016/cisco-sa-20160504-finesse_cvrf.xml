  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger the Finesse server to perform an HTTP request to an arbitrary host. This type of attack is commonly referred to as server-side request forgery (SSRF).



The vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls for the Finesse application programming interface (API) for gadgets integration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to the Finesse server.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
