An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected system with administrative privileges and inserting arbitrary commands. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system with the privileges of root.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.



This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160921-csp2100-1["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160921-csp2100-1"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco Cloud Services Platform 2100 version 2.0 is affected.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability
described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect
support for software versions and feature sets for which they have
purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise
using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of
the Cisco software license: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a
valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco
authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance
upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security
software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license,
additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade
contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software
configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new
release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to
contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted
maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their
point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html



["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]Customers should have the product serial number available and be
prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement
to a free upgrade.



Fixed Releases

This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Cloud Services Platform (CSP) 2100 release 2.1.0 and later.
