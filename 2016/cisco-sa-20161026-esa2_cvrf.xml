    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the email attachment scanning functionality of the Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop scanning and forwarding email messages due to a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of UU-encoded files that are attached to an email message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email message with a UU-encoded file attachment through an affected device. The scanning of the attachment could cause the mail handling process of the affected software to restart, resulting in a DoS condition. After the mail handling process restarts, the software resumes scanning for the same attachment, which could cause the mail handling process to restart again. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a repeated DoS condition.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link:


http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161026-esa2["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161026-esa2"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS Software releases 9.7.1 and later, prior to the first fixed release, for both virtual and hardware Cisco Email Security Appliances, if the AMP feature is configured to scan incoming email attachments.



To determine whether AMP is configured on a Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), administrators can use the Cisco AsyncOS System Administration GUI or the command-line interface (CLI).



In the System Administration GUI, choose Security Services &gt; File Reputation and Analysis, and then check the setting for the File Reputation option.



In the CLI, issue the ampconfig command and check the value of the File Reputation field in the command output. The following example shows the output of the ampconfig command for an ESA that has AMP configured to scan incoming email attachments:

ciscoesa&gt; ampconfig

File Reputation: Enabled
File Analysis: Enabled
File types selected for File Analysis:
    Microsoft Windows / DOS Executable
Appliance Group ID/Name: Not part of any group yet

To determine which release of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on an ESA, administrators can use the version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the version command for an ESA running Cisco AsyncOS Software Release 8.5.7-044:


ciscoesa&gt; version

Current Version
===============
Product: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance
Model: X1070
Version: 8.5.7-044
.
.
.

Note that Cisco provides regular maintenance of products in the Cisco Cloud Email Security (CES) service solution, which includes Cisco Email Security Appliances and Cisco Content Security Management Appliances. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.



Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products:


    Cisco Content Security Management Appliance, virtual and hardware versions
    Cisco Web Security Appliance, virtual and hardware versions
</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.



Fixed Releases



Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:
