    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the malicious file detection and blocking features of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass malware detection mechanisms on an affected system.



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of fields in HTTP headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass malicious file detection or blocking policies that are configured for the system, which could allow malware to pass through the system undetected.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160330-fp["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160330-fp"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco Firepower System Software that has one or more file action policies configured and is running on any of the following Cisco products:


    Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series with FirePOWER Services
    Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Networks, 7000 Series Appliances
    Advanced Malware Protection  (AMP) for Networks, 8000 Series Appliances
    FirePOWER 7000 Series Appliances
    FirePOWER 8000 Series Appliances
    FirePOWER Threat Defense for Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)
    Next Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS) for Blue Coat X-Series
    Sourcefire 3D System Appliances
    Virtual Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPSv) for VMware

To determine whether any file action policies are configured in Cisco Firepower System Software, administrators can do the following in the Firepower System dashboard:




    Choose Policies &gt; Access Control &gt; Malware and File. The dashboard displays a list of file action policies that are configured for the system.
    Click the Report icon next to a policy to see details about the current saved configuration for the policy.



Each file action policy specifies a set of rules and actions that define how to handle files that meet specific criteria. If one or more policies specify a  Block Files, Block Malware, or Detect Files action, the system is vulnerable.



This vulnerability also affects the open source Snort project if the source code is compiled with the --enable-file-inspect configuration flag. For more information, see the Snort website["https://www.snort.org/"].</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.



Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:


    Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software
    Firepower 4100 Series Security Appliances
    Firepower 9300 Series Security Appliances
    Firepower Management Center
    Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Software
    Snort IPS for Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)
</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:

 http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html[" http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"].



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"].



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.



Fixed Releases



This vulnerability has been addressed in the following releases of Cisco Firepower System Software:


    5.4.0.7 and later
    5.4.1.6 and later
    6.0.1 and later

Customers should install the appropriate fixed release by using the software update features of Cisco Firepower Management Center.



This vulnerability has also been addressed in Snort versions 2.9.8.2 and later. Snort users can obtain updates from the Snort website["https://www.snort.org/"].</Note>
