    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the email message filtering feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.



The vulnerability exists because the message filtering feature of the affected software does not properly validate compressed message attachments that contain malformed Design (DGN) files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email message, which has a compressed attachment containing a malformed DGN file, through an affected device. While the affected software filters the attachment, memory could be consumed at a high rate and ultimately exhausted, causing the filtering process to restart and resulting in a DoS condition. After the filtering process restarts, the software resumes filtering for the same attachment, causing the filtering process to exhaust memory and restart again. A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to cause a repeated DoS condition.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link:


http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161026-esa1["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161026-esa1"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects all releases prior to the first fixed release of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances, both virtual and hardware appliances, if the software is configured to apply a message filter that contains any of the following rules:


    body-contains
    attachment-contains
    every-attachment-contains
    attachment-binary-contains
    dictionary-match
    attachment-dictionary-match

To determine which message filters are configured for a Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), administrators can use the filters detail all command in the command-line interface (CLI). The following example shows the output of the filters detail all command for an ESA that is configured to use a generic message filter:


esa.prompt&gt; filters detail all

Num Active Valid Names
  1   Y      Y    example_filter
example_filter: if body-contains("example", 1) {
                    quarantine("Policy");
                   }

To determine which release of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on an ESA, administrators can use the version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the version command for an ESA running Cisco AsyncOS Software Release 8.5.7-044:


ciscoesa&gt; version

Current Version
===============
Product: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance
Model: X1070
Version: 8.5.7-044
.
.
.

Note that Cisco provides regular maintenance of products in the Cisco Cloud Email Security (CES) service solution, which includes Cisco Email Security Appliances and Cisco Content Security Management Appliances. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.



Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products:


    Cisco Content Security Management Appliance, virtual and hardware versions
    Cisco Web Security Appliance, virtual and hardware versions
</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
