    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the detection engine reassembly of HTTP packets for Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the Snort process unexpectedly restarting. 



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of an HTTP packet stream. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP packet stream to the detection engine on the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition if the Snort process restarts and traffic inspection is bypassed or traffic is dropped.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following Cisco products are affected when they are running software versions 5.4.0.6, 5.4.1.5, 6.0, or 6.0.0.1:


    Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series with FirePOWER Services
    Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Networks, 7000 Series Appliances
    Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Networks, 8000 Series Appliances
    Firepower 4100 Series Security Appliances
    FirePOWER 7000 Series Appliances
    FirePOWER 8000 Series Appliances
    Firepower 9300 Series Security Appliances
    FirePOWER Threat Defense for Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)
    Industrial Security Appliance 3000
    Sourcefire 3D System Appliances
    Virtual Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPSv) for VMware

This vulnerability also affects the open source Snort project. For more information, see the Snort website["https://www.snort.org/"].</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:


    Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software
    Firepower Management Center
    Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Software
    Snort IPS for Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">This vulnerability can result in the Snort process restarting. While the Snort process is restarting, Snort detection could be bypassed or all network traffic inspection could fail. The behavior is platform and configuration dependent.



FirePOWER Platforms 


    Passive and bypass interfaces will bypass Snort inspection and pass the traffic. 
    Routed, switched, and non-bypass interfaces will drop the traffic. 
    FirePOWER Threat Defense (FTD) will drop the traffic.

Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series with FirePOWER Services


    If the ASA release supports the command-line interface (CLI) command sfr fail-open and it is configured, traffic will bypass Snort and not be dropped.

    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"].



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"].



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

 

Fixed Releases



This vulnerability has been addressed in the following releases of Firepower System Software:


    5.4.0.7
    5.4.1.6
    6.0.1
    6.1.0

To upgrade the Firepower System Software use one of the following methods:


    With Firepower Management Center (FMC), customers should install the fixed version of the software and apply the access control policy after the installation.
    With Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) or Firepower Device Manager (FDM), customers should upgrade to the fixed version of the software and apply the access control policy after the installation.
