    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the 802.11 wireless LAN protocol for Cisco Access Point (AP) platforms could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition when the device unexpectedly reloads.



The vulnerability is due to rate limiting of 802.11 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted 802.11 traffic to the targeted adjacent device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
