    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the SSH subsystem of the Cisco Nexus family of products could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) restrictions.



The vulnerability is due to the improper processing of certain parameters that are passed to an affected device during the negotiation of an SSH connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and passing a malicious value as part of the login procedure. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass AAA restrictions and execute commands on the device command-line interface (CLI) that should be restricted to a different privileged user role.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link:

</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"].



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"].



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.



Fixed Releases



Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the applicable table in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:

    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the SSH subsystem of the Cisco Nexus family of products could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) restrictions.



The vulnerability is due to the improper processing of certain parameters that are passed to an affected device during the negotiation of an SSH connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and passing a malicious value as part of the login procedure. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass AAA restrictions and execute commands on the device command-line interface (CLI) that should be restricted to a different privileged user role.</Note>
