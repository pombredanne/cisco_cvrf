    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the implementation of intra-process communication for Cisco UCS Invicta Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to connect to the affected system with the privileges of the root user. 



The vulnerability is due to the presence of a default SSH private key that is stored in an insecure way on the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining the SSH private key and connecting using the root account to the system without providing a password. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to the system with the privileges of the root user.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.



This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160406-ucs["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160406-ucs"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following products running an affected version of the software are affected:


    Whiptail Racerunner 
    Cisco UCS Invicta Scaling System and Appliance 
    Cisco UCS Invicta C3124SA Appliance
</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.
</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:



http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"] 



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades. 



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. 



Customers Without Service Contracts 



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):



http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"] 



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. 



Fixed Releases 



This vulnerability is resolved in Cisco UCS Invicta Scaling System and Appliance Software versions 5.0.1.3b and later and Cisco UCS Invicta C3124SA Appliance Software versions 5.0.1.2c and later.</Note>
