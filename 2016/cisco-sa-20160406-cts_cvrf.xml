    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco TelePresence Server devices running software versions 3.0 through 4.2(4.18) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a kernel panic on the device.



The vulnerability exists due to a failure to properly handle a specially crafted stream of IPv6 packets. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause a kernel panic, rebooting the device.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.




This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160406-cts["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160406-cts"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following Cisco TelePresence Server device running Cisco TelePresence Server software versions 3.0 to 4.2(4.18) are vulnerable:


    Cisco TelePresence Server Mobility Services Engine (MSE) 8710
</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Customers that do not use IPv6 for teleconferencing can disable IPv6 as a workaround until the system can be updated. 



Customers can disable IPv6 calling with the following commands:


Network &gt; Network Settings &gt; IP Configuration

 

Disable IPv6 on the port.

 

Note: You can disable IPv6 on the TelePresence Server port, but only if logged in using IPv4.

 

When finished, click Update IP Configuration.

</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]




Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.




When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.




Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]




Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
