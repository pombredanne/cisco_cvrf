  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) BRIDGE Management Information Base (MIB) of the Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to a faulty implementation of certain SNMP Object Identifiers (OIDs) within the BRIDGE MIB. An SNMP request for certain Object Identifiers (OIDs) within the BRIDGE MIB can cause the device to reload unexpectedly. If an attacker knows the SNMP community string, the attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing an authenticated SNMP request of the BRIDGE MIB OID to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload with each SNMP request, creating a DoS condition.



Cisco has released not software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.



This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160216-grid["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160216-grid"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Router is affected by this vulnerability if SNMP functionality is configured in the software.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Exploitation of this vulnerability will cause an affected device to reload and generate a core file. Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to review the file and determine whether the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Administrator can disable SNMP functionality if it is not required. If SNMP functionality is required, administrators can discontinue polling BRIDGE MIB OIDs.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerability Policy" Type="General" Ordinal="7">To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the Security Vulnerability Policy["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/psirt/security_vulnerability_policy.html"]. This document also contains instructions for obtaining fixed software and receiving security vulnerability information from Cisco.</Note>
    <Note Title="Exploitation and Public Announcements" Type="General" Ordinal="8">The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.</Note>
