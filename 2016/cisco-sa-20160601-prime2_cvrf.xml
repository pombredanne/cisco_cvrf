    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Prime Network Analysis Module (NAM) and Cisco Prime Virtual Network Analysis Module (vNAM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code on the host operating system with the privileges of the web server.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input before the input is used in subsequent operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code on the host operating system with the reduced privileges of the web server.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160601-prime2["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160601-prime2"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following Cisco products are affected by this vulnerability:


    Cisco Prime Network Analysis Module (NAM) releases 6.2(1b) and prior
    Cisco Prime Network Analysis Module (NAM) releases 6.1(1) and prior if the final security patch (nam-security-patch.6.1-2-final) has not been applied
    Cisco Prime Virtual Network Analysis Module (vNAM) releases 6.2(1b) and prior
    Cisco Prime Virtual Network Analysis Module (vNAM) releases 6.1(1) and prior if the final security patch (nam-security-patch.6.1-2-final) has not been applied
</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their
point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC):


http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

 

Fixed Releases



Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in this section.



For Cisco Prime NAM and Cisco Prime vNAM Release 6.2(1b), install the software patch named nam-cve-2016-1391-patch.6.2-1-b.i386.rpm, which addresses this vulnerability and will be integrated into the upcoming 6.2(2) Release. To install the patch, the system must be running Release 6.2(1b).



For Cisco Prime NAM and Cisco Prime vNAM Release 6.2(1) or prior, upgrade to Release 6.2(2) when the release is available. 



For Cisco Prime NAM and Cisco Prime vNAM Release 6.1(1) or prior, install the software patch named nam-security-patch.6.1-2-final.i386.rpm, which addresses this vulnerability.



Software for Cisco Prime NAM and Cisco Prime vNAM can be downloaded from the Software Center on Cisco.com["https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html"] by navigating to Products &gt; Cloud and Systems Management &gt; Network Analysis Module (NAM) Products.</Note>
