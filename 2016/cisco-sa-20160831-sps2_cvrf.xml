    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Plus (Sx220) Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the web-based management interface of an affected device to stop responding, resulting in a partial denial of service (DoS) condition on the device.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of HTTP requests by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device via the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the interface to stop responding, resulting in a partial DoS condition that persists until the interface is restarted manually.



Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
