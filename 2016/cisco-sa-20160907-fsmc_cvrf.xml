    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in session identification management functionality of the web-based management interface for Cisco Firepower Management Center and Cisco FireSIGHT System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack a valid user session.



The vulnerability exists because the affected application does not assign a new session identifier to a user session when a user authenticates to the application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a hijacked session identifier to connect to the application through the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated userâ€™s browser session.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
