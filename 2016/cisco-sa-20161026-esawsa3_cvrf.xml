    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) and Web Security Appliances (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a partial denial of service (DoS) condition due to the AMP process unexpectedly restarting.



The vulnerability is due to improper validation of a Java Archive (JAR) file that is scanned when AMP is configured. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a JAR file and attaching this JAR file to an email that is then sent through the ESA, or allowing the JAR file to be download from the web through the WSA. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco ESA and WSA AMP process to unexpectedly restart due to the malformed JAR file.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.

http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161026-esawsa3["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161026-esawsa3"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following products are affected:


    Cisco AsyncOS Software for Email Security Appliances (ESA) versions 9.5 and later up to the first fixed release
    Cisco AsyncOS Software for Web Security Appliances (WSA) all versions prior to the first fixed release

To determine which release of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on an ESA, administrators can use the version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the version command for an ESA running Cisco AsyncOS Software Release 8.5.7-044:


ciscoesa&gt; version

Current Version
===============
Product: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance
Model: X1070
Version: 8.5.7-044
.
.
.

Note that Cisco provides regular maintenance of products in the Cisco Cloud Email Security (CES) service solution, which includes Cisco Email Security Appliances and Cisco Content Security Management Appliances. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.



To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco WSA, administrators can use the version command in the WSA CLI. The following example shows the results for an appliance running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 8.5.3-051:



ciscowsa&gt; version

Current Version

===============

Product: Cisco IronPort S670 Web Security Appliance

Model: S670

Version: 8.5.3-051
