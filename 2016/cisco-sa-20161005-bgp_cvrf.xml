    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) implementation of Cisco NX-OS System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the device unexpectedly reloading.



The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the BGP update messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP update message to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to reload unexpectedly. 



The Cisco implementation of the BGP protocol only accepts incoming BGP traffic from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer, or inject malformed messages into the victim's BGP network. This would require obtaining information about the BGP peers in the affected system's trusted network.



The vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a malformed BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. At least one BGP neighbor session must be established for a router to be vulnerable.



If all BGP peers to the NX-OS Software are Cisco IOS, IOS-XE, or IOS-XR devices and those devices are not configured for Cisco Multicast VPN (MVPN) interautonomous system support, this vulnerability cannot be remotely exploited.


Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.

http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-bgp["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-bgp"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following Cisco products are affected by this vulnerability when configured with BGP:

    Nexus 1000v Series Switches
    Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders
    Nexus 3000 Series Switches
    Nexus 3500 Platform Switches
    Nexus 5000 Series Switches
    Nexus 5500 Platform Switches
    Nexus 5600 Platform Switches
    Nexus 6000 Series Switches
    Nexus 7000 Series Switches
    Nexus 7700 Series Switches
    Nexus 9000 Series Switches in ACI mode
    Nexus 9000 Series Switches in NX-OS mode


The vulnerability affects only NX-OS devices configured with BGP functionality and, in addition, the device needs to have at least one BGP neighbor (peer) configured. The potentially malicious BGP peer needs to be configured on the NX-OS device as a BGP neighbor. This vulnerability applies to BGP traffic destined for the device. The device processes BGP packets on TCP port 179 on either IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6).



To determine whether a Nexus device is configured with the BGP feature and a BGP neighbor, administrators can use the show running-config | include "router bgp" and show running-config | include "neighbor" commands from the NX-OS command-line interface (CLI) and verify that the feature is enabled.



The following example shows the BGP feature enabled with one BGP neighbor on a device running NX-OS Software:


nxos-switch# show running-config | include "router bgp"
router bgp 64512
nxos-switch#
nxos-switch# show running-config | include "neighbor"
neighbor 209.165.201.1 remote-as 64497
nxos-switch#


Administrators can check the version of NX-OS Software running on their device by utilizing the show version command from the device CLI.  The following example identifies the 6.2(14) release:


nxos-switch# show version

    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The following Cisco products are not affected by this vulnerability:


    Multilayer Director Switches
    Nexus 4000 Series Switches
    Unified Computing System (UCS) 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects
    Unified Computing System (UCS) 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects



 No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause an affected device to reload and generate an URIB core file. To view the URIB core file, administrators can use the show core command in the NX-OS CLI. Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to review the URIB core file and determine whether the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"].



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized re-seller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"].



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

 

Fixed Releases



Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the applicable table in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:

    <Title>Cisco NX-OS BGP Denial of Service Vulnerability</Title>
    <ID SystemName="Cisco Bug ID">CSCuq77105</ID>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) implementation of Cisco NX-OS System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the device unexpectedly reloading.



The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the BGP update messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP update message to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to reload unexpectedly. 



The Cisco implementation of the BGP protocol only accepts incoming BGP traffic from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer, or inject malformed messages into the victim's BGP network. This would require obtaining information about the BGP peers in the affected system's trusted network.



The vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a malformed BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. At least one BGP neighbor session must be established for a router to be vulnerable.



If all BGP peers to the NX-OS Software are Cisco IOS, IOS-XE, or IOS-XR devices and those devices are not configured for Cisco Multicast VPN (MVPN) interautonomous system support, this vulnerability cannot be remotely exploited.
