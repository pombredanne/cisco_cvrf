    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco TelePresence Server devices running software versions 4.1(2.29) through 4.2(4.17) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload.

 

The vulnerability exists due to a failure of the HTTP parsing engine to handle specially crafted URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple URL requests to an affected device. The requests will eventually time out because negotiation from the client does not occur; however, each request consumes additional memory, resulting in memory exhaustion that causes the device to crash. If successful, the attacker could utilize all available memory resources, causing the device to reload.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.




This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160406-cts1["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160406-cts1"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following Cisco TelePresence Server devices running Cisco TelePresence Server software versions 4.1(2.29) through 4.2(4.17) are vulnerable:


    Cisco TelePresence Server 7010
    Cisco TelePresence Server Mobility Services Engine (MSE) 8710
    Cisco TelePresence Server on Multiparty Media 310
    Cisco TelePresence Server on Multiparty Media 320
    Cisco TelePresence Server on Multiparty Media 820
    Cisco TelePresence Server on Virtual Machine (VM)
</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">In most instances, the log files may be used to determine if a device has been compromised. If an attacker uses inaccessible URLs to exhaust memory, the following log messages will appear:

 


HTTP: Info: new incoming connection “____” from :

HTTP: Info: new incoming tx tunnel channel for “____”

HTTP: Warning: failing incomplete connection “____” from :

</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]




Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.




When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.




Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]




Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.



Fixed Releases

Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the applicable table in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:
