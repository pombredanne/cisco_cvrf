    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web application of the Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored, cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of parameter values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by storing malicious code on a device and waiting for a user to access a web page that triggers execution of the code. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web interface on the affected device.
