    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the XML application programming interface (API) of Cisco TelePresence Codec (TC) and Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and access a targeted system through the API.



The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of authentication mechanisms for the XML API of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the XML API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform unauthorized configuration changes or issue control commands to the affected system by using the API.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160504-tpxml["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160504-tpxml"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco TelePresence Software releases TC 7.2.0, TC 7.2.1, TC 7.3.0, TC 7.3.1, TC 7.3.2, TC 7.3.3, TC 7.3.4, TC 7.3.5, CE 8.0.0, CE 8.0.1, and CE 8.1.0 running on the following Cisco products:


    TelePresence EX Series
    TelePresence Integrator C Series
    TelePresence MX Series
    TelePresence Profile Series
    TelePresence SX Series
    TelePresence SX Quick Set Series
    TelePresence VX Clinical Assistant
    TelePresence VX Tactical



Determining the Cisco TelePresence Software Release



To determine which  Cisco TelePresence Software release is running on a Cisco product, administrators can check the system information on the local touch control device or on-screen via the infrared (IR) remote controller.



Administrators can also determine which software release is running by logging in to the web interface and using the http(s):// command or, via the external API (xAPI) with the SSH protocol, using the ssh admin@ command. After logging in to the web interface, the welcome text displays information about the software release that is running on the device.




For example, the following welcome text appears for a Cisco TelePresence Magnus SX80 codec that is running software release CE 8.2.0:

Welcome to Magnus SX80
Cisco Codec Release ce 8.2.0 PreAlpha1 c6612ca 2016-04-25
SW Release Date: 2016-04-25 14:58:45, matchbox
</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.



Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:

    TelePresence IX5000 Series
    TelePresence System 500 Series
    TelePresence System 3000 Series
    TelePresence System T Series
    TelePresence TX Series
</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">To work around this vulnerability, administrators can disable the XML API on an affected system. However, this API is used by the Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS), which means that administrators will not be able to manage the system by using TMS if they disable the API.



To disable the XML API, do the following in the web interface of the software:




    Navigate to xConfig &gt; NetworkServices &gt; XMLAPI &gt; Mode.
    Change the Mode setting to Off.



Reboot the main device for the new configuration to take effect. The device can be rebooted from the local touch control device or the IR remote controller.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt ["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt "]and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.



Fixed Releases



This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco TelePresence Codec (TC) and Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software releases TC 7.3.6 and CE 8.1.1.



Cisco TelePresence Software can be downloaded from the Software Center on Cisco.com["http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html "] by navigating to Products &gt; Video &gt; Cisco TelePresence.</Note>
