    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in TCP port management in Cisco ONS 15454 Series Multiservice Provisioning Platforms could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the controller card to unexpectedly reload.



The vulnerability is due to a specific TCP port listening on the local management port when it should have been internal only. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a continuous stream of TCP traffic to the targeted device on the specific TCP port. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the controller card to unexpectedly reset. The user traffic is not impacted; however, the management port traffic could be briefly disrupted.



There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco ONS 15454 Series Multiservice Provisioning Platforms. For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The administrator can set the LAN config mode to Ethernet Switch. This configuration setting can help avoid the unexpected controller reset due to TCP congestion on the management port. The unexpected reset has been observed only with the MSM configuration setting.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
