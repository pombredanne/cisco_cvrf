  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the ASN1C compiler by Objective Systems affects Cisco ASR 5000 devices running StarOS and Cisco Virtualized Packet Core (VPC) systems. The vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition or potentially execute arbitrary code.



The vulnerability is due to unsafe code generation by the ASN1C compiler when creating ASN.1 translation functions that are subsequently included within affected Cisco products. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) encoded message designed to trigger the issue to an affected function.



US-CERT has released Vulnerability Note VU#790839["http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/790839"] to document the issue.



Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link:

    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco ASR 5000 devices running StarOS versions 17.x, 18.x, 19.x, and 20.x are affected.



Cisco Virtualized Packet Core systems versions V18.x, V19.x, and V20.x are affected.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No workarounds are available.
</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Cisco will release fixed software versions for affected products.
