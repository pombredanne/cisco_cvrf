    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on a targeted system.

 

The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of HTTP user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request with custom user data. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root-level privileges on the affected system, which could be leveraged to conduct further attacks.



Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.




This advisory is available at the following link: 



http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160615-rv["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160615-rv"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">All releases of the following Cisco products are affected by this vulnerability:


    RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall
    RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router
    RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router

The web-based management interface is available for these devices via a local LAN connection or the remote management feature. By default, the remote management feature is disabled for the affected devices.



To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled for a device, open the web-based management interface for the device and then choose Basic Settings &gt; Remote Management. If the Enable check box is checked, remote management is enabled for the device.


</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.



Fixed Releases



Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in this section.



For the Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, this vulnerability was addressed in firmware release 1.0.3.16.



For other affected devices, Cisco plans to release the following firmware updates in the third quarter of 2016:


    Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Release 1.2.1.7
