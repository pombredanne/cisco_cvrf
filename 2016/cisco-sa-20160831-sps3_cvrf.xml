  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the implementation of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) functionality in Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Plus (Sx220) Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to SNMP objects on an affected device.



The vulnerability is due to the presence of a default SNMP community string that is added during device installation and cannot be deleted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the default SNMP community string to access SNMP objects on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and modify SNMP objects on a targeted device.



Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link:

    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Plus (Sx220) Switches that are running firmware release 1.0.0.17, 1.0.0.18, or 1.0.0.19 and have the SNMP feature enabled. The SNMP feature is disabled by default on Sx220 Switches.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
Fixed Releases
This vulnerability has been fixed in firmware release 1.0.1.1 for Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Plus (Sx220) Switches.



Customers are advised to download the latest firmware release from the Software Center["http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html"] on Cisco.com by navigating to Products &gt; Switches &gt; LAN Switches &gt; Small Business &gt; Small Business 220 Series Smart Plus Switches.</Note>
