    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) devices running Cisco AireOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The  vulnerability is due to the presence of unsupported URLs in the web-based device management interface provided by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to access a URL that is not generally accessible from and supported by the management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability. 



This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160420-wlc["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160420-wlc"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco WLC devices running the following releases of Cisco AireOS Software are vulnerable:


    Releases 4.1 through 7.4.120.0
    All 7.5 releases
    Release 7.6.100.0
</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.



Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect devices running Cisco AireOS Software Release 8.0 or later.</Note>
    <Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause an affected device to reload and generate a crash file. Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to review the crash file and determine whether the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Customers may protect an affected device from exploitation by implementing a CPU access control list (ACL) on the management interface of the device.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.



Fixed Releases



Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:
