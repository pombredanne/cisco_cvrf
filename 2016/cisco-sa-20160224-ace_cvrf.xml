    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Device Manager GUI of the Cisco ACE 4710 Application Control Engine could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute any command-line interface (CLI) command on the ACE with admin user privileges. 



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTTP POST request with injected CLI commands inside the value of a POST parameter value. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the role-based access control (RBAC) restrictions enforced by the Cisco ACE Device Manager GUI.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.




This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160224-ace["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160224-ace"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco ACE 4710 Application Control Engine running A5 software releases up to A5(3.0) is vulnerable when configured to allow access to the Device Manager GUI.
Inspect the relevant sections of the configuration to determine whether Device Manager GUI access is configured on the ACE, as shown in the following example:


ace-4710-1/Admin# show running-config
Generating configuration....
[...]

class-map type management match-any my-mgmt-class
202 match protocol icmp any
203 match protocol https any
204 match protocol ssh any
[...]

policy-map type management first-match my-mgmt-pol
class my-mgmt-class
permit
[...]

interface vlan 2
[...]
service-policy input my-mgmt-pol
service-policy input other-traffic
no shutdown
To determine which software version is running on the appliance, administrators  can issue the show version command. The following is an example of the output of this command issued on a system running software version A5(3.2):

    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.



Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:


    Cisco ACE Application Control Engine Module
    Cisco Application Networking Manager (ANM) 
</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Administrators can disable management access to the Cisco ACE 4710 Application Control Engine Device Manager GUI until the appropriate fix can be applied. The following example shows how to disable access, assuming the device is configured with the following management class map:



class-map type management match-any my-mgmt-class
202 match protocol icmp any
203 match protocol https any  
204 match protocol ssh any


ace-4710-1/Admin# configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.

ace-4710-1/Admin(config)# class-map type management match-any my-mgmt-class
ace-4710-1/Admin(config-cmap-mgmt)# no match protocol https any</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

 

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

 

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

 

Customers Without Service Contracts

 

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]

 

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
