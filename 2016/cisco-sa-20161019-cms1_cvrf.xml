    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Web Bridge for Cisco Meeting Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve memory from a connected server.



The vulnerability is due to missing bounds checks in the Web Bridge functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted packet to the affected server. An exploit could allow the attacker to disclose a portion of memory from the server for every packet. The disclosed portions of memory could contain sensitive information such as private keys or passwords.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
