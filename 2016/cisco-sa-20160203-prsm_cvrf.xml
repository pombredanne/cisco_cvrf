    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the role-based access control of Cisco ASA-CX and Cisco Prime Security Manager (PRSM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to change the password of any user on the system.



The vulnerability exists because the password change request is not fully qualified. An authenticated attacker with a user role other than Administrator could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the Cisco PRSM. An exploit could allow the attacker to change the password of any user on the system, including users with the Administrator role.


Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. 



This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160203-prsm["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160203-prsm"]
</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">All versions of Cisco ASA-CX Content-Aware Security and Cisco PRSM software prior to 9.3.1.1(112) are affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory.



To determine the running version of Cisco ASA-CX software, issue the show version command from the Cisco ASA-CX command-line interface, to which an administrator can obtain access via serial console, an SSH session to the ASA-CX management interface, or a session opened from the parent ASA using the session command. 



The following example shows Cisco ASA-CX software version 9.2.1.3(11) and Cisco PRSM Version 9.2.1.3(11):


asacx&gt; show version
Cisco ASA CX Platform  9.2.1.3(11)
Cisco Prime Security Manager 9.2.1.3(11) for asacx firewall
asacx&gt;


Customers using Cisco PRSM to manage Cisco ASA-CX devices can locate the software version of Cisco ASA-CX in the Device &gt; Devices menu item of the Cisco Prime Security Manager window.




To determine the running version of Cisco PRSM software, issue the show version command from the Cisco PRSM command-line interface, which an administrator can obtain access to via the PRSM VMware console or an SSH session to the Cisco PRSM management interface.



The following example shows Cisco PRSM software version 9.0.1(40):


prsm&gt; show version
Cisco Prime Security Manager 9.0.1 (40) Multi Device prsm-vm



Customers using HTTPS to access Cisco PRSM can locate the software version of Cisco PRSM in the Administration &gt; About PRSM menu item of the Cisco Prime Security Manager window.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.




Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):



http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
