    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Slowpath of StarOS for Cisco ASR 5500 Series routers with Data Processing Card 2 (DPC2) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a subset of the subscriber sessions to be disconnected, resulting in a partial denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to improper processing during the handoff of reassembled IPv4 or IPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv4 or IPv6 fragments across the ASR 5500 Series router. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an instance of the sessmgr service on the affected device to reload. A reload of the sessmgr service will cause all subscriber sessions serviced by that task to be disconnected, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link:

http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161102-asr["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161102-asr"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 5500 devices with Data Processing Card 2 (DPC2) running StarOS 18.0 or later.



To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco StarOS is running, administrators can use the show version command in the command-line interface (CLI). The following example shows the output of the show version command for a router that is running Cisco StarOS Release 19.2.1:



    [local]ASR-2# show version
    Friday August 12 13:17:31 AST 2016
    Active Software:
      Image Version:                  19.2.1
      Image Build Number:             62564
      Image Description:              Deployment_Build
      Image Date:                     Thu Dec 31 20:13:39 EST 2015
      Boot Image:                     /flash/asr5500-19.2.1.bin


To determine whether DPC2 cards are in use on a device, administrators can use the show card table command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the show card table command for a router that has active DPC2 cards in slots 2 and 3:



    [local]ASR-2# show card table
    Friday August 12 13:18:25 AST 2016
    Slot         Card Type                  Oper State     SPOF  Attach
    -----------  -------------------------  -------------  ----  ------

     2: DPC      Data Processing Card 2     Active         No          
     3: DPC      Data Processing Card 2     Active         No          
     4: DPC      None                       -              -

    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products:


    Cisco ASR 5000 Series Routers
    Cisco ASR 5500 Series Routers with DPC1 cards
    Cisco Virtualized Packet Core (VPC) 

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.
</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">To work around and help prevent the effects of an attempt to exploit this vulnerability, administrators can change the maximum transmission unit (MTU) configuration on one or more internal interfaces for an affected device. Note that this workaround will not persist if a card is rebooted. If a card is rebooted, the MTU configuration must be changed again. For information about implementing this workaround, please contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco provides information about fixed software in Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"].




When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.




In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers</Note>
