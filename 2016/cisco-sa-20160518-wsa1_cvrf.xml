    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability that occurs when parsing an HTTP POST request with Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability due to the proxy process becoming unresponsive.



The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of the packets that make up the HTTP POST request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition due to the proxy process becoming unresponsive and the WSA reloading.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.




This advisory is available at the following link:



http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160518-wsa1["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160518-wsa1"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS versions for Cisco WSA on both virtual and hardware appliances. See the "Fixed Software" section of this security advisory for additional information about the affected software versions.



To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco WSA, administrators can use the version command in the WSA command-line interface (CLI). The following example shows the results for an appliance running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 8.5.3-051:



ciscowsa&gt; version

Current Version

    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.



The following products are not affected by this vulnerability:


    Email Security Appliance (ESA), both virtual and hardware versions
    Security Mail Appliance (SMA), both virtual and hardware versions
</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"].



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.




Customers Without Service Contracts



Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"].



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.



Fixed Releases



Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:

In most cases, a WSA can be updated over the network by using the System Upgrade options in the System Administration GUI. To upgrade a device by using the System Administration GUI:



Choose System Administration &gt; System Upgrade.

Click Upgrade Options.

Choose Download and Install.

Choose the release to upgrade to.

In the Upgrade Preparation area, choose the appropriate options.

Click Proceed to begin the upgrade. A progress bar displays the status of the upgrade.

After the upgrade is complete, the device reboots.
