    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files and execute commands as the prime web user. The prime web user does not have the full privileges of root.



The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to upload arbitrary files and execute commands as the prime web user.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
