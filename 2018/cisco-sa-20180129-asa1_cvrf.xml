    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Update from February 5, 2018: After further investigation, Cisco has identified additional attack vectors and features that are affected by this vulnerability. In addition, it was also found that the original fix was incomplete so new fixed code versions are now available. Please see the Fixed Software ["#fixed"] section for more information.


A vulnerability in the XML parser of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. It was also possible that  the ASA could stop processing incoming Virtual Private Network (VPN) authentication requests due to a low memory condition.

The vulnerability is due to an issue with allocating and freeing memory  when processing a malicious XML payload. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted XML packet to a vulnerable interface on an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system, cause a reload of the affected device or stop processing of incoming VPN authentication requests.

To be vulnerable the ASA must have Secure Socket Layer (SSL) services or IKEv2 Remote Access VPN services enabled on an interface. The risk of the vulnerability being exploited also depends on the accessibility of the interface to the attacker. For a comprehensive list of vulnerable ASA features please refer to the table in the  Vulnerable Products ["#vulnerable"] section.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address all the features that are affected by this vulnerability.

4The REST API is first supported as of software release 9.3.2. The REST API is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured http command range.
5SAML SSO is first supported as of software release 9.6.

The customer can also use the show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS command and look for an SSL or a DTLS listen socket on any TCP port. If either socket is present in the output and the ASA device is configured for one or more of the ASA features in the above table, the device is considered vulnerable. The following example shows an ASA device with SSL and DTLS listen sockets:
ciscoasa# show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS
SSL       00185038  LISTEN     172.16.0.250:443    0.0.0.0:*
SSL       00188638  LISTEN     10.0.0.250:443      0.0.0.0:*
DTLS      0018f7a8  LISTEN     10.0.0.250:443      0.0.0.0:*
  The customer can also check the show asp table socket stats protocol ssl command to list the underlying SSL system statistics. The SSL statistics indicate the number of each type of message received and is further verification that the ASA device is vulnerable.
ciscoasa# show asp table socket stats protocol ssl
NP SSL System Stats:
  Handshake Started:          83
  Handshake Complete:         60
  SSL Open:                    7
  SSL Close:                 285
  SSL Server:                 84
  SSL Server Verify:           0
  SSL Client:                  0
  Note: While certain IKEv2 feature sets do not enable the underlying SSL TCP listening socket, they may still be vulnerable. Customers can use the CLI command show running-config crypto ikev2 to check if the configuration command crypto ikev2 enable is present in the configuration.
ciscoasa# show running-config crypto ikev2 | include enable
crypto ikev2 enable Outside
  If a command like crypto ikev2 enable is present in the running configuration and the command anyconnect enable is part of the global webvpn configuration, the ASA device is also considered vulnerable.

Determining the ASA Running Software Release

To determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software is running on a device, administrators can use the show version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.2(1):
ciscoasa# show version | include Version
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.2(1)
Device Manager Version 7.4(1)
  Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.

FTD Software

  This vulnerability applies to all FTD releases before the first fixed software release. The FTD release contains both Firepower and ASA code. Please review the Firepower Threat Defense Devices section in the Cisco Firepower Compatibility Guide ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/compatibility/firepower-compatibility.html#reference_070E1908889545BDB6CC564676202628"] for additional information.

    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Update from February 5, 2018: After further investigation, Cisco has identified additional attack vectors and features that are affected by this vulnerability. In addition, it was also found that the original fix was incomplete so new fixed code versions are now available. Please see the Fixed Software ["#fixed"] section for more information. 






A vulnerability in the XML parser of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. It was also possible that  the ASA could stop processing incoming Virtual Private Network (VPN) authentication requests due to a low memory condition.



The vulnerability is due to an issue with allocating and freeing memory  when processing a malicious XML payload. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted XML packet to a vulnerable interface on an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system, cause a reload of the affected device or stop processing of incoming VPN authentication requests.



To be vulnerable the ASA must have Secure Socket Layer (SSL) services or IKEv2 Remote Access VPN services enabled on an interface. The risk of the vulnerability being exploited also depends on the accessibility of the interface to the attacker. For a comprehensive list of vulnerable ASA features please refer to the table in the  Vulnerable Products ["#vulnerable"] section.</Note>
