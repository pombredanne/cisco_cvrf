    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the ingress flow creation functionality of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the CPU to increase upwards of 100 percent utilization, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of an internal software lock that could prevent other system processes from getting CPU cycles, causing a high CPU condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of malicious IP packets that can cause connections to be created on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust CPU resources, resulting in a DoS condition during which traffic through the device could be delayed. This vulnerability applies to either IPv4 or IPv6 ingress traffic either to or across an affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa2 ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa2"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software that is running on the following Cisco products:

3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISA)
ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances
ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls
ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers
Adaptive Security Virtual Appliances (ASAv)
Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances
Firepower 4110 Security Appliances
Firepower 9300 ASA Security Modules
  For information about which software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180404-asa1#Fixed"] section of this advisory.
Determining the ASA Software Release  To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on a device, administrators can use the show version | include Version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.4(4):
ciscoasa# show version | include Version
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.4(4)
Device Manager Version 7.4(1)
  Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.

Determining the Cisco Firepower System Software Release
To determine which Cisco Firepower System Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the show version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Release 6.2.0:


&gt; show version

---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------
Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362)
UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c
Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt
VDB version : 279
----------------------------------------------------</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The ASA and FTD configuration commands, set connection per-client-embryonic-max (TCP) and set connection per-client-max (TCP, UDP, and Stream Control Transmission Protocol {SCTP}), can be configured to limit the number of connection requests allowed. Using these configuration parameters can reduce the number of connections and greatly reduce the impact of the DoS attack.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html ["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Fixed Releases  Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the table(s) in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:
