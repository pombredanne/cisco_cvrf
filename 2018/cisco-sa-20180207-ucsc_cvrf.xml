  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in an operations script of Cisco UCS Central could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the daemon user.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by posting a crafted request to the user interface of Cisco UCS Central.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180207-ucsc ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180207-ucsc"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco UCS Central Software prior to Release 2.0(1c).

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco has confirmed that Cisco UCS Manager is not vulnerable.</Note>
    <Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">To determine which release of the software is currently running on a device, administrators may use the show version command in the device CLI. The output of the command in the CLI is similar to the following example (which shows release 2.0(1a) installed):

UCSC-Primary# show version

Name                Package             Version        GUI
----                -------             -------        ----
core                Base System         2.0(1a)        2.0(1a)
policy-mgr          Policy Manager      2.0(1a)        2.0(1a)
.

.
The currently running release is also displayed on the login screen of the GUI.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Fixed Releases

Cisco UCS Central Release 2.0(1c) resolves this vulnerability.
  Software is available for download from Cisco Software Central ["https://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=286312995&amp;flowid=82511&amp;softwareid=284308194&amp;release=2.0(1c)&amp;relind=AVAILABLE&amp;rellifecycle=&amp;reltype=latest"] from the following path: Downloads Home &gt; Products &gt; Servers - Unified Computing &gt; UCS Central Software &gt; UCS Central 2.x.</Note>
