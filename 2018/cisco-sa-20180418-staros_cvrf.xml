    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the egress packet processing functionality of the Cisco StarOS operating system for Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 5700 Series devices and Virtualized Packet Core (VPC) System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an interface on the device to cease forwarding packets. The device may need to be manually reloaded to clear the condition.

The vulnerability is due to the failure to properly check that the length of a packet to transmit does not exceed the maximum supported length of the network interface card (NIC). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IP packet or a series of crafted IP fragments through an interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the network interface to cease forwarding packets. This vulnerability could be triggered by either IPv4 or IPv6 network traffic.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-staros ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-staros"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products when they are running the StarOS operating system and a virtual interface card is installed on the device:

Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 5700 Series
Virtualized Packet Core—Distributed Instance (VPC—DI) System Software
Virtualized Packet Core—Single Instance (VPC—SI) System Software

To determine whether a virtual interface card is installed on the ASR 5700 Series device or VPC—SI or VPC—DI, administrators can issue the show support details | grep 'Cisco VIC' command at the device CLI.


staros# show support details | grep 'Cisco VIC'
2017-Oct-25+02:07:52.813 card 6-cpu0: &lt;6&gt;[   10.967629] enic: Cisco VIC Ethernet NIC Driver, ver 2.1.1.39


Determining the StarOS Software Release

To determine whether a vulnerable release of StarOS is running on an ASR 5700 Series device, administrators can issue the show version command at the device CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a Cisco ASR 5500 Series Router that is running Cisco StarOS Release 19.2.1:


[local]ASR-2# show version

To determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco StarOS is running on a VPC—SI or VPC—DI, administrators can issue the show version command at the device CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a VPC—DI that is running Cisco StarOS Release 20.1.v0 (VPC—DI Release N4.6):


[local]VPC-DI# show version

    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html ["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
