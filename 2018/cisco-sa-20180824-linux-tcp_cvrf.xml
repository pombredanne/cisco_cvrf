  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">On August 6, 2018, the Vulnerability Coordination team of the National Cyber Security Centre of Finland (NCSC-FI) and the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) disclosed vulnerabilities in the TCP stacks that are used by the Linux and FreeBSD kernels. These vulnerabilities are publicly known as SegmentSmack.

The vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. An attack could be executed by using low transfer rates of TCP packets, unlike typical distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

The vulnerabilities are due to inefficient TCP reassembly algorithms in the TCP stacks that are used by the affected kernels. Linux Kernel Versions 4.9 and later and all supported versions of the FreeBSD kernel are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a stream of packets that are designed to trigger the issue in an established TCP session with an affected device. A sustained DoS condition requires the attacker to maintain a continuous stream of malicious traffic. Due to the required use of an established session, an attack cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses.

This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.

Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180824-linux-tcp ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180824-linux-tcp"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco is investigating its product line to determine which products and services may be affected by these vulnerabilities. The investigation is focusing primarily on Cisco products that use Linux Kernel Version 4.9 or later or any supported version of the FreeBSD kernel. However, reports have indicated that some earlier versions of the Linux Kernel may be affected in similar ways if they are exposed to the same attack at significantly higher traffic rates. Therefore, Cisco is also evaluating the impact on these systems.

The “Vulnerable Products” section of this advisory includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product or service. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"] and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.

Any product or service not listed in the “Products Under  Investigation” or “Vulnerable Products” section of this advisory is to  be considered not vulnerable. Because this is an ongoing investigation,  be aware that products and services that are currently considered not  vulnerable may subsequently be considered vulnerable as additional  information becomes available.

  Products Under Investigation
The following products are under active investigation to determine whether they are affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.
  Voice and Unified Communications Devices

Cisco Webex Video Mesh Node
Cisco Webex Hybrid Data Security Node</Note>

    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Only products and services listed in the “Vulnerable Products” section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products and services:
  Network and Content Security Devices
Cisco Firepower Management Center
Video, Streaming, TelePresence, and Transcoding Devices
Cisco TelePresence MCU 4200 Series and 4500 Series
Cisco TelePresence Advanced Media Gateway Series</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Any workarounds will be documented in the product-specific Cisco bugs, which are identified in the “Vulnerable Products” section of this advisory.

It is important to note that exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires an attacker to establish a TCP three-way handshake with an  open TCP port on an affected device. Customers are therefore advised to use an external  firewall to allow only explicitly trusted source IP addresses to connect to open TCP ports on affected devices.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bugs identified in the “Vulnerable Products” section of this advisory.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to  regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available  from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded  contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and  software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the  new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to  contact the Cisco TAC or their contracted maintenance providers.</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerability Policy" Type="General" Ordinal="7">To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the Security Vulnerability Policy ["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/psirt/security_vulnerability_policy.html"]. This document also contains instructions for obtaining fixed software and receiving security vulnerability information from Cisco.</Note>
    <Note Title="Exploitation and Public Announcements" Type="General" Ordinal="8">The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.</Note>
    <Note Title="Source" Type="General" Ordinal="9">These vulnerabilities were reported by Juha-Matti Tilli, of the Aalto University Department of Communications and Networking, and Nokia Bell Labs.</Note>

  <Vulnerability Ordinal="1" xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/ns/csaf-cvrf/v1.2/vuln">
    <Title>Linux Kernel TCP Reassembly Algorithm Remote Denial of Service Vulnerability</Title>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Linux Kernel could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted system.



The vulnerability exists because the affected software uses an inefficient TCP reassembly algorithm. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending TCP packets within ongoing sessions that submit malicious input to a targeted system. A successful exploit could trigger resource-intensive time and calculation calls to the tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() functions of the software, which could consume excessive CPU resources, resulting in a DoS condition.</Note>
