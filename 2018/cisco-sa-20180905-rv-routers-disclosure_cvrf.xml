    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.

The vulnerability is due to improper access control to files within the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive configuration information, including user authentication credentials.


Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180905-rv-routers-disclosure ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180905-rv-routers-disclosure"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects all releases of the following Cisco products:
RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall
RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router
RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router

The web-based management interface for these devices is available via a local LAN connection or via the remote management feature. By default, the remote management feature is disabled for the affected devices.

To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled for a device, open the web-based management interface for the device via a local LAN connection and then choose Basic Settings &gt; Remote Management. If the Enable check box is checked, remote management is enabled for the device.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">For the Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, Cisco has released free firmware updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory.

For the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall and the Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router, Cisco has not released and will not release firmware updates to address the vulnerability described in this advisory.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
  Fixed Releases
Cisco fixed this vulnerability in firmware release 1.0.3.44 for the RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router.

For other affected devices, Cisco will not release firmware updates,  as other affected products are end of life and end of software support.

Customers can download the firmware updates from the Software Center on Cisco.com by doing the following:

Click Browse all
Navigate to Routers &gt; Small Business Routers &gt; Small Business RV Series Routers &gt; RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router &gt; Small Business Router Firmware
Access releases by using the left pane of the RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router page</Note>
