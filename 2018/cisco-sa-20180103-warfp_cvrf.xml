    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF) files could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system of a targeted user. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending the user a link or email attachment with a malicious ARF file and persuading the user to follow the link or launch the file. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user’s system.

The Cisco WebEx Players are applications that are used to play back WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded by an online meeting attendee. The player can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx server.

Cisco has updated the affected version of the Cisco WebEx Business Suite meeting sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings Server, and Cisco WebEx ARF players to address this vulnerability.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
