  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Apache Struts could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a targeted system.

The vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently validates user-supplied input, allowing the use of results with no namespace value and the use of url tags with no value or action. In cases where upper actions or configurations also have no namespace or a wildcard namespace, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request that submits malicious input to the affected application for processing. If successful, the attacker could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the affected application on the targeted system.
The following  Snort rules can be used to detect possible exploitation of this  vulnerability: Snort SID 29639, 39190, 39191, and 47634

    <Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The Vulnerable Products ["#vulnerable"] section includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product or service. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"] and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.

Any product or service not listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vulnerable"] section of this advisory is to be considered not vulnerable.</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Vulnerable products marked with an asterisk (*) contain an affected Struts library, but due to how the library is used within the product, these products are not vulnerable to any of the exploitation vectors known to Cisco at the time of publication.
