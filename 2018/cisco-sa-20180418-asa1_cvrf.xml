    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Virtual Private Network (VPN) Client Certificate Authentication feature for Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to establish an SSL VPN connection and bypass certain SSL certificate verification steps.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect verification of the SSL Client Certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the ASA VPN without a proper private key and certificate pair. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to establish an SSL VPN connection to the ASA when the connection should have been rejected.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa1 ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa1"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software that is running on the following Cisco products:
3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISA)
ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances
ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls
ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers
Adaptive Security Virtual Appliances (ASAv)
Firepower 4110 Security Appliances
Firepower 9300 ASA Security Modules

To be considered vulnerable, the ASA or FTD has to be configured for Client Certificate Authentication. Administrators can check for a vulnerable configuration using the show running-config tunnel-group | include authentication | include certificate command. If either the authentication certificate or authentication multiple-certificate configuration option is present in the configuration then the device is vulnerable. The following is an example of a vulnerable configuration:


asa# show running-config tunnel-group | include authentication | include certificate
authentication certificate  authentication multiple-certificate
    Vulnerable ASA Software  ASA Software is only vulnerable if running one of the following software versions:

Release 9.4
ASA software versions 9.4.3.1, 9.4.3.2 and 9.4.4 through 9.4.4.13

Release 9.5
ASA software versions 9.5.2.7, 9.5.2.8 and 9.5.3.7 through 9.5.3.9

Release 9.6
ASA software versions 9.6.2.9 through 9.6.2.21 and 9.6.3 through 9.6.3.17
Determining the ASA Software Release  To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on a device, administrators can use the show version | include Version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.4(4):
ciscoasa# show version | include Version
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.4(4)
Device Manager Version 7.4(1)
  Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.  Vulnerable FTD Software  FTD software is only vulnerable if running one of the following software versions:

Release 6.0
FTD software versions 6.0 through 6.0.1.4.

Release 6.1
FTD software versions 6.1.0 through 6.1.0.5.
Determining the Running FTD Software Release  Administrators can use the show versionCLI command to determine the FTD release. In this example, the device is running software release 6.1.0.
&gt; show version

    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances.
No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html ["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
  Fixed Releases  Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the table(s) in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:
