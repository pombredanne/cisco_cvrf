    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface or conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this security advisory.

There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180905-pcce ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180905-pcce"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise. For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug IDs at the top of this advisory.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Two vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface or conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.

The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.

Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack against a user of the interface.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a customized link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information.

The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0444

The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: Medium


Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a CSRF attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a customized link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on a targeted device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user.

The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0445

The SIR for this vulnerability is: Medium</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.</Note>
