    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the implementation of a specific CLI command and the associated Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) MIB for Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust system memory on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to the incorrect implementation of the CLI command, resulting in a failure to free all allocated memory upon completion. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device and repeatedly issuing a specific CLI command or sending a specific SNMP poll request for a specific Object Identifier (OID). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IP routing process to restart or to cause a device reset, resulting in a DoS condition.


Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software.

For information about which Cisco NX-OS Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.


Checking the Status of SNMP

Administrators can check whether SNMP is running on a device by using the show running-config snmp command on the device CLI. If the command returns output, SNMP is configured.


nxos-switch# show running-config snmp
!Command: show running-config snmp  .  .  .  snmp-server user admin network-admin auth md5 ***** priv ***** localizedkey  snmp-server community &lt;removed&gt; group network-admin

  Determining the Cisco NX-OS Software Release
  Administrators can check the release of Cisco NX-OS Software that is running on a device by using the show version command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.0(3)I5(1):


nxos-switch# show version

For more information, refer to the End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Nexus 4000 Series Switch Modules for IBM BladeCenter ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-4000-series-switches/eos-eol-notice-c51-733205.html"] and the End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Nexus 5010 and Nexus 5020 Switches ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-5000-series-switches/eol_c51-709037.html"].</Note>
    <Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application-layer protocol that provides a standardized framework and a common language for monitoring and managing devices in a network. It defines a message format for communication between SNMP managers and agents.

An SNMP agent gathers data from the SNMP MIB, which is the repository of information about device parameters and network data. It also responds to requests from an SNMP manager to get or set data. An SNMP agent contains MIB variables for which values can be requested or changed by an SNMP manager by using get or set operations.

This vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP supported on the deviceâ€”Versions 1, 2c, and 3. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific SNMP packet to an affected device via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. A community string is a password that is applied to a device to restrict both read-only and read-write access to the SNMP data on the device. These community strings, as with all passwords, should be chosen carefully to ensure that they are not trivial. They should also be changed at regular intervals and in accordance with network security policies. For example, the strings should be changed when a network administrator changes roles or leaves the organization.

To exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system.


To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must take time to repeatedly send a specific CLI command or send a specific SNMP poll request for a specific OID to the affected device. Therefore, the attacker cannot immediately exhaust system memory; instead, system resources would be consumed over time.</Note>
    <Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Exploitation of this vulnerability could exhaust system memory. The administrator can monitor the IPFIB process memory usage using the show process memory | include ipfib | PID command. If an ongoing increase is observed in the total amount of memory allocated to the IPFIB process, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to help determine if a proactive reboot of the device is needed:
# show process memory | include ipfib | PID
PID    MemAlloc  MemLimit    MemUsed     StackBase/Ptr      Process  25179  71282688  1181531648  487817216   ffaf2ca0/ffaf1d9c  ipfib  26561  352071680 0           905453568   ff9a87a0/ff9a78a0  ipfib    # show processes memory | include ipfib | PID  PID    MemAlloc  MemLimit    MemUsed     StackBase/Ptr      Process  25179  71282688  1181531648  487817216   ffaf2ca0/ffaf1d9c  ipfib  26561  358326272 0           911708160   ff9a87a0/ff9a78a0  ipf
    In addition, exploitation of this vulnerability could cause an affected device to reload and generate an IPFIB core file. To view the IPFIB core file, administrators can use the show core command in the NX-OS CLI. Contact the Cisco TAC to review the core file and determine whether the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.


As a mitigation for the vulnerability that is described in this advisory, administrators can configure an access control list (ACL) on an SNMP community to filter incoming SNMP requests to ensure that SNMP polling is performed only by trusted SNMP clients. In the following example, the device will accept incoming SNMP requests only from a single trusted host, 192.168.1.2:


switch# show access-list acl_for_snmp
IPV4 ACL acl_for_snmp    10 permit udp 192.168.1.2/32 192.168.1.3/32 eq snmp

To implement the preceding ACL, administrators can add it to the snmp-server community configuration command:


switch# show running-config snmp
!Command: show running-config snmp  snmp-server community mycompany   use-acl acl_for_snmp

For additional information about configuring ACLs to filter incoming SNMP requests, see Filtering SNMP Requests ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/system_management/b_Cisco_Nexus_5000_Series_NX-OS_System_Management_Configuration_Guide/Cisco_Nexus_5000_Series_NX-OS_System_Management_Configuration_Guide_chapter9.html#task_D3862190751F4B1A9F5353B015A888A7"] in the NX-OS Configuration Guide.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
