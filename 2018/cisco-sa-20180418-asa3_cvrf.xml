    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) library of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of the affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious TLS message to an interface enabled for Secure Layer Socket (SSL) services on an affected device. Messages using SSL Version 3 (SSLv3) or SSL Version 2 (SSLv2) cannot be be used to exploit this vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer underflow, triggering a crash on an affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa3 ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa3"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software that is running on the following Cisco products:

Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)
Firepower Threat Defense Virtual (FTDv)
Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliance
 ASA Software Cisco ASA Software is only vulnerable if running software version 9.2 or later.

In the following table, the left column lists the vulnerable Cisco ASA features. The right column indicates the vulnerable configuration from the CLI command show running-config, if it can be determined.

                           Feature             Vulnerable Configuration
                                         Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM)1

1 ASDM is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured http command range.
2 Cisco Security Manager is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured http command range.
3 SAML SSO is first supported as of software release 9.6.
 Determining the Cisco ASA Software Release  To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on a device, administrators can use the show version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.7(1)4:
ciscoasa# show version | include Version
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.7(1)4  Firepower Extensible Operating System Version 2.1(1.66)  Baseboard Management Controller (revision 0x1) Firmware Version: 2.4
    Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window. FTD Software The FTD Software is only vulnerable if running software versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.1.0, 6.2.1, or 6.2.2 prior to their respective first fixed releases.

In the following table, the left column lists the vulnerable Cisco FTD features. The right column indicates the vulnerable configuration from the CLI command show running-config, if it can be determined.

                           Feature             Vulnerable Configuration
                                         HTTP Service enabled1             http server enable &lt;port #&gt;
http &lt;remote_ip_address&gt; &lt;remote_subnet_mask&gt; &lt;interface_name&gt;                               AnyConnect SSL VPN2,3             webvpn
   enable &lt;interface_name&gt;
1 The HTTP feature is enabled via the Firepower Threat Defense Platform Settings &gt; HTTP configuration page on the Firepower Management Console (FMC).
2 Remote Access VPN features are enabled via the Devices &gt; VPN &gt; Remote Access configuration page on the FMC or via the Device &gt; Remote Access VPN configuration page on the Firepower Device Manager (FDM).
3 Remote Access VPN features are first supported as of software release 6.2.1.
 Determining the Cisco FTD Software Release
To determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the show version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.2:


&gt; show version

    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
 Fixed Releases  Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the table(s) in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:
