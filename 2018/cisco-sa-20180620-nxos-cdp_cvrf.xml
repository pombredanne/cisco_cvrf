    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol (formerly known as CDP) subsystem of devices running, or based on, Cisco NX-OS Software contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly validate certain fields within a Cisco Discovery Protocol message prior to processing it. An attacker with the ability to submit a Cisco Discovery Protocol message designed to trigger the issue could cause a DoS condition on an affected device while the device restarts.


Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:

This advisory is part of the June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection, which includes 24 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 24 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-67770"].</Note>
    <Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2" />
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco FXOS Software, Cisco NX-OS Software, or Cisco UCS Manager Software:

Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall
Firepower 9300 Security Appliance
MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Director Switches
Nexus 1000V Series Switches

UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects

For information about which Cisco FXOS, NX-OS, and UCS Manager Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.
  Assessing the Cisco Discovery Protocol Configuration
To determine whether a device is configured to use Cisco Discovery Protocol, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show cdp global command in the CLI. If the device is configured to use Cisco Discovery Protocol, the output of the command will be similar to the following:


CLI(config)# show cdp global
Global CDP information:    CDP enabled globally    Refresh time is 60 seconds    Hold time is 180 seconds    CDPv2 advertisements is enabled    DeviceID TLV in System-Name(Default) Format

If use of Cisco Discovery Protocol is configured for only specific interfaces of a device, administrators can instead use the show cdp interface command in the CLI to determine which interfaces are configured to use Cisco Discovery Protocol.

Determining the Cisco FXOS Software Release
Administrators can check the release of Cisco FXOS Software that is running on a device by using the following commands in the device CLI or by navigating to the Overview tab in the Admin portal. The following example shows the output of the show version CLI command on a device that is running Cisco FXOS Software Release 2.2(2.14), as identified in the Package-Vers field of the command output:


QP4120B1 # scope system
QP4120B1 /system # show version  FPRM:  Running-Vers: 4.2(2.15)  Package-Vers: 2.2(2.14)  Activate-Status: Ready


Determining the Cisco NX-OS Software Release
Administrators can check the release of Cisco NX-OS Software that is running on a device by using the show version command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of this command on a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.3(2)D1(1):


nxos-switch# show version

    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Firepower 2100 Series and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode.


Cisco has not investigated whether this vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 4000 Series Switches, Cisco Nexus 5010 Switches, or Cisco Nexus 5020 Switches because those products have reached end-of-life status. For more information, refer to the End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Nexus 4000 Series Switch Modules for IBM BladeCenter ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-4000-series-switches/eos-eol-notice-c51-733205.html"] and the End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Nexus 5010 and Nexus 5020 Switches ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-5000-series-switches/eol_c51-709037.html"].</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.


  Fixed Releases

Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the applicable table in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection. For a complete list of the advisories in the collection and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection ["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-67770"].

In the following tables, the left column lists releases of Cisco FXOS or NX-OS Software. The center column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by all the vulnerabilities described in this collection of advisories and which release includes fixes for those vulnerabilities.
