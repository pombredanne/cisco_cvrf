    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the Login Enhancements (Login Block) feature of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected system, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this security advisory.

There are no workarounds that address both vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-slogin ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-slogin"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.4(2)T, 15.4(3)M, or 15.4(2)CG and later.
  Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release
To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.

The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:


Router&gt; show version
  Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)  Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.  Compiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod_rel_team  .  .  .

For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software releases, see the Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html"].</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software.</Note>
    <Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Cisco IOS Login Enhancements (Login Block) Feature
The Cisco IOS Login Enhancements (Login Block) feature allows users to enhance the security of a router by configuring options to automatically block further login attempts when a possible DoS attack is detected.

The login block and login delay options introduced by this feature can be configured for Telnet or SSH virtual connections. By enabling this feature, you can slow down “dictionary attacks” by enforcing a “quiet period” if multiple failed connection attempts are detected, thereby protecting the routing device from a type of DoS attack.

Further information on the Login Enhancements (Login Block) feature is available in the Cisco IOS Security Configuration Guide ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/sec_user_services/configuration/guide/12_4/sec_securing_user_services_12-4_book/sec_login_enhance.html"].
  Vulnerability Details
Two vulnerabilities in the Login Enhancements (Login Block) feature of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.

Cisco IOS Software Login Block Denial of Service Vulnerability



A vulnerability in the Login Enhancements (Login Block) feature of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected system, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to an attempt to free an area of memory that has not been previously allocated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to log in to an affected device via Secure Shell (SSH) or Telnet with invalid credentials multiple times.

This vulnerability is exploitable only if both of the following conditions are met:

login quiet-mode access-class has been configured prior to configuring login block-for. These features are not enabled by default.
The device has not been reloaded since that configuration occurred.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0179

The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: Medium

The Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: CSCuy32360
