    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass security protections, gain elevated privileges, and execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is due to insecure key generation during application configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a known insecure key value to bypass security protections by sending arbitrary requests using the insecure key to a targeted application. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180221-ucdm ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180221-ucdm"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager releases prior to 11.5(2), including Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Classic releases 8.1.9 and prior.

To determine which release of the software is currently running on a device, administrators may use the app status command in the device CLI. The output of the command in the CLI is similar to the following example:

    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Fixed Releases

The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager releases 11.5(2) and later.

The software can be downloaded from the Software Center ["https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html"] on Cisco.com by  navigating to Products &gt; Unified Communications &gt; Call Control &gt; Hosted  Collaboration &gt; Hosted Collaboration Solution (HCS) &gt;  Hosted Collaboration Solution Version 11.5 &gt; Unified Communications Domain  Manager (CUCDM) Updates-11.5(2).
  A patch for Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Classic release 8.1(9) ER1 can be downloaded from the Software Center ["https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html"] on Cisco.com by  navigating to Products &gt; Unified Communications &gt; Call Control &gt; Hosted  Collaboration &gt; Hosted Collaboration Solution (HCS) &gt;  Hosted Collaboration Solution Version 11.5 &gt; Unified Communications Domain Manager (CUCDM) Updates-8.1.9ER1.</Note>
