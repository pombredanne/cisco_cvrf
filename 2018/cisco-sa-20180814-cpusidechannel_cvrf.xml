  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">5On August 14th, 2018, three vulnerabilities were disclosed by Intel and security researchers that leverage a speculative execution side-channel method referred to as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) that affects modern Intel microprocessors. These vulnerabilities could allow an unprivileged, local attacker, in specific circumstances, to read privileged memory belonging to other processes.
The first vulnerability, CVE-2018-3615, affects Intel SGX technology and is referred to by the researchers who discovered it as foreshadow. This vulnerability is not known to affect any Cisco devices as the Cisco devices do not utilize Intel SGX technology.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-3620, and the third vulnerability, CVE-2018-3646, are referred to as L1 Terminal Fault attacks by Intel. These two vulnerabilities affect multi-core processors that leverage Intel Hyper-Threading technology supporting Operating System, System Management Mode, and Virtualized workloads. Like the previously disclosed Spectre vulnerabilities, all three new vulnerabilities leverage cache-timing attacks to infer any disclosed data.

To exploit any of these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be able to run crafted or script code on an affected device. Although the underlying CPU and operating system combination in a product or service may be affected by these vulnerabilities, the majority of Cisco products are closed systems that do not allow customers to run custom code and are, therefore, not vulnerable. There is no vector from which to exploit them. Cisco products are considered potentially vulnerable only if they allow customers to execute custom code side-by-side with Cisco code on the same microprocessor.

A Cisco product that may be deployed as a virtual machine or a container, even while not directly affected by any of these vulnerabilities, could be targeted by such attacks if the hosting environment is vulnerable. Cisco recommends that customers harden their virtual environments, tightly control user access, and ensure that all security updates are installed. Customers who are deploying products as a virtual device in multi-tenant hosting environments should ensure that the underlying hardware, as well as the operating system or hypervisor, is patched against the vulnerabilities in question.

Although Cisco cloud services are not directly affected by these vulnerabilities, the infrastructure on which they run may be impacted. See the Affected Products ["#ap"] section of this advisory for information about the impact of these vulnerabilities on Cisco cloud services.

Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

    <Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Any product or service not listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory is to be considered not vulnerable. The criteria for considering whether a product is vulnerable is explained in the Summary ["#sum"] section of this advisory.

Because this is an ongoing investigation, please be aware that products and services currently considered not vulnerable may subsequently be considered vulnerable as additional information becomes available.

    <Title>Modern CPU L1 Terminal Fault - SGX</Title>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">
A
vulnerability due to the design of modern Intel CPUs could allow a local
attacker to access sensitive information on a targeted system.

The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the
speculative execution of instructions by the affected microprocessors. This
vulnerability can be triggered by causing the CPU to attempt to perform a L1 Data Cache Terminal Fault when exiting from an Intel SGX container. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing
arbitrary code and performing a side-channel attack on the cache of the
targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read
sensitive memory information.


This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2018-3615

vulnerability due to the design of modern Intel CPUs could allow a local
attacker to access sensitive information on a targeted system.

The
vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the
speculative execution of instructions by the affected microprocessors.
This
vulnerability can be triggered by causing the CPU to perform a
L1 Data Cache Terminal Fault while the Operating System performs specific actions.  The issue may also be trigger while a system exits the System Management Mode. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing
arbitrary code and performing a side-channel attack on the cache of the
targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read
sensitive memory information.

A vulnerability due to the design of modern Intel CPUs could allow a local attacker to access sensitive information on a targeted system.



The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the speculative execution of instructions by the affected microprocessors. This vulnerability can be triggered by causing the CPU to perform a L1 Data Cache Terminal Fault from within a virtualized environment hosted on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code and performing a side-channel attack on the cache of the targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read sensitive memory information.
