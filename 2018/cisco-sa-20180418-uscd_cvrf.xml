  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the role-based resource checking functionality of the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view unauthorized information for any virtual machine in the UCS Director end-user portal and perform any permitted operations on any virtual machine. The permitted operations can be configured for the end user on the virtual machines with either of the following settings:
The virtual machine is associated to a Virtual Data Center (VDC) that has an end user self-service policy attached to the VDC.
The end user role has VM Management Actions settings configured under User Permissions. This is a global configuration, so all the virtual machines visible in the end-user portal will have the VM management actions available.
  The vulnerability is due to improper user authentication checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the UCS Director with a modified username and valid password. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain visibility into and perform actions against all virtual machines in the UCS Director end-user portal of the affected system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-uscd ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-uscd"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Director releases 6.0 and 6.5 prior to patch 3 that are in a default configuration.

This vulnerability can be exploited via the web interface (GUI). The Rest API interface is not affected.

Both locally authenticated and LDAP-authenticated accounts can be used to exploit this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Although this vulnerability does not affect the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor, the same modified login can be used. However, the login does not expose any unintended data.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products:

Cisco Unified Computing System Director Releases prior to 6.0
Cisco Unified Computing System Director Express for Big Data</Note>
    <Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">An authenticated user who logs in to the system and exploits this vulnerability will have visibility into all virtual machines shown in the Virtual Resources menu. The actions that a user may perform against the virtual machines will depend on the actions that are permitted in either of the following:

The assigned end user self-service policy for the VDC in Policies &gt; Virtual/Hypervisor Policies &gt; Service Delivery &gt; End User Self-Service Policy
The userâ€™s role as defined in System &gt; User Roles &gt; User Permissions &gt; VM Management Actions
 If the UCS Director is configured in Service Provider Feature mode, an authenticated user who logs in to the system and exploits this vulnerability will have visibility into all virtual machines shown in the Virtual Resources menu, including those from other tenants.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Fixed Releases

This vulnerability is fixed in the Cisco UCS Director 6.5.0.3 upgrade patch. The patch can be downloaded from the Software Center ["https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html"] on Cisco.com by navigating to Products &gt; Servers - Unified Computing &gt; UCS Director &gt; UCS Director 6.5 &gt; UCS Director Virtual Appliance Software-6 ["https://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=286315747&amp;softwareid=285018084&amp;release=6&amp;flowid=82911"].</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerability Policy" Type="General" Ordinal="7">To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the Security Vulnerability Policy ["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/psirt/security_vulnerability_policy.html"]. This document also contains instructions for obtaining fixed software and receiving security vulnerability information from Cisco.</Note>
    <Note Title="Exploitation and Public Announcements" Type="General" Ordinal="8">The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.</Note>
