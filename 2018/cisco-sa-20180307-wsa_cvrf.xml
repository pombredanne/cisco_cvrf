    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the FTP server of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to the FTP server of the device without a valid password. The attacker does need to have a valid username.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect FTP user credential validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using FTP to connect to the management IP address of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the FTP server of the Cisco WSA without having a valid password.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180307-wsa ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180307-wsa"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS for WSA Software on both virtual and hardware appliances that are running any release of Cisco AsyncOS 10.5.1 for WSA Software. See the Fixed Software ["#Fixed"] section of this security advisory for additional information about the affected software releases.

The device is vulnerable only if FTP is enabled on the management interface. FTP is disabled by default.
  Determining Whether FTP Is Configured
An administrator can determine whether FTP is configured on the management interface by using one of the following three methods.

First Method to Determine Whether FTP Is Configured

The administrator can issue the showconfig command and check whether the ftpd port is configured on the management interface.


ciscowsa&gt; showconfig
Choose the password option:
1. Mask passwords (Files with masked passwords cannot be loaded using loadconfig command)
2. Plain passphrases
[1]&gt; 1
.
.
.
&lt;interfaces&gt;
&lt;interface&gt;
&lt;interface_name&gt;Management&lt;/interface_name&gt;
&lt;ip&gt;x.x.x.x&lt;/ip&gt;
&lt;phys_interface&gt;Management&lt;/phys_interface&gt;
&lt;netmask&gt;24&lt;/netmask&gt;
&lt;interface_hostname&gt;xxx.xxx.xxx&lt;/interface_hostname&gt;
&lt;ftpd_port&gt;21&lt;/ftpd_port&gt;
.
.
.

Second Method to Determine Whether FTP Is Configured

The administrator can check the  FTP configuration by issuing the ifconfig command. In this example, the management interface is configured for FTP. The Y value in square brackets represents the current configuration.


ciscowsa&gt; ifconfig
.
.
.
Choose the operation you want to perform:
- NEW - Create a new interface.
- EDIT - Modify an interface.
- DELETE - Remove an interface.
- DETAILS - Show details of an interface.
&gt; EDIT

Enter the number of the interface you wish to edit.
[]&gt; 1
.
.
Do you want to enable FTP on this interface? [Y]&gt;
.
.
.

Third Method to Determine Whether FTP Is Configured
  The administrator can also use the GUI to check the FTP configuration by navigating to Network &gt; Interfaces &gt; Appliance Management Services and determining whether the FTP check box is checked.

Determining the WSA Software Release
To determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco WSA, administrators can use the version command in the WSA CLI. The following example shows the results for an appliance that is running Cisco AsyncOS Software Release 10.5.1-296:


ciscowsa&gt; version
Current Version
===============
Product: Cisco IronPort S670 Web Security Appliance
Model: S670
Version: 10.5.1-296

The following products are not affected by this vulnerability:

      Email Security Appliance (ESA), both virtual and hardware versions
      Security Mail Appliance (SMA), both virtual and hardware versions</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, this vulnerability exists only when FTP is enabled on the management interface. If FTP is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist; therefore, disabling FTP is considered a mitigation for the vulnerability.


  Disabling FTP on the Management Interface

    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html ["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
