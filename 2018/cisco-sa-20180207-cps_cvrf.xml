    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the RADIUS authentication module of Cisco Policy Suite could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to be authorized as a subscriber without providing a valid password; however, the attacker must provide a valid username.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect RADIUS user credential validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to access a Cisco Policy Suite domain configured with RADIUS authentication. An exploit could allow the attacker to be authorized as a subscriber without providing a valid password.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180207-cps ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180207-cps"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the Cisco Policy Suite application running a release prior to 13.1.0 with Hotfix Patch 1 when RADIUS authentication is configured for a domain. Cisco Policy Suite Release 14.0.0 is also affected, as it includes vulnerable code, but RADIUS authentication is not officially supported in Cisco Policy Suite Releases 14.0.0 and later. See the Fixed Software ["#Fixed"] section of this security advisory for additional information about the affected software versions.

To determine which software version is running on the application, administrators can issue the about.sh command from the CLI. In the following example, the device is running software release 12.1.0:
# about.sh
Cisco Policy Suite - Copyright (c) 2015. All rights reserved.
CPS Multi-Node Environment
CPS Installer Version - 12.1.0
.

CPS Patch History
---------------------------
No patches have been applied
.
.
.

The system is vulnerable only if RADIUS is used for authentication in a domain. RADIUS authentication is not enabled by default. Administrators can use the Policy Builder GUI to verify if RADIUS authentication is configured for a domain by accessing the Services tab and selecting the appropriate domain under the Domains tab. On the General tab, administrators can check if USuM Authorization is selected and the User Id Field and Password Field are populated with RADIUS Username and RADIUS Password respectively.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Fixed Releases

In the following table, the left column lists major releases of Cisco Policy Suite software. The right column indicates whether a major release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first minor release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.

Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following table:
                                Cisco Policy Suite Major Release                            First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability                                  Prior 12.x
              Vulnerable. Upgrade to 13.1.0 and apply Hotfix Patch 1.
                                  12.x
              Vulnerable. Upgrade to 13.1.0 and apply Hotfix Patch 1.
                                  13.0
              Vulnerable. Upgrade to 13.1.0 and apply Hotfix Patch 1.
                                  13.1
              Vulnerable. Apply Hotfix Patch 1.
                                  14.0
              Vulnerable. 1
                                  18.0
              Not vulnerable.

1 Cisco Policy Suite Release 14.0 includes vulnerable code, but does not officially support RADIUS authentication. The subsequent Cisco Policy Suite Release 18.0 does not support RADIUS authentication and does not include vulnerable code.

The Cisco Policy Suite 13.1.0 Hotfix Patch 1 and other Cisco Policy Suite software can be downloaded from the Software Center ["https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html"] on Cisco.com by choosing Downloads Home &gt; Products &gt; Wireless &gt; Mobile Internet &gt; Policy Suite for Service Providers &gt; Policy Suite for Wi-Fi &gt; Cisco Policy Suite (CPS) Software

To apply the Hotfix Patch 1 on Cisco Policy Suite Release 13.1.0, please refer to the Apply a Patch section in the CPS Migration and Upgrade Guide, Release 13.1.0 [" https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/quantum-policy-suite/R13-1-0/CPS13-1-0MigrationandUpgradeGuide/CPS12-1-0MigrationandUpgradeGuide_chapter_010.html#id_11097"] document.

To verify if the Hotfix Patch 1 has been applied to the system, administrators can issue the about.sh command from the CLI. In the following example, the output from the about.sh command provides verification that the patch has been installed:
# about.sh
