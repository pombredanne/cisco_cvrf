    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the IPv6 subsystem of Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.3.4 for the Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 9000 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of one or more Trident-based line cards, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of IPv6 packets with a fragment header extension. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending IPv6 packets designed to trigger the issue either to or through the Trident-based line card. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of Trident-based line cards, resulting in a DoS during the period of time the line card takes to restart.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180131-ipv6 ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180131-ipv6"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 9000 Series when the following conditions are met:

The router is running Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.3.4.
The router has installed Trident-based line cards that have IPv6 configured.
  Determining the Cisco IOS XR Software Release

To determine which Cisco IOS XR Software release is running on a device and the name of the device on which it is running, administrators can log in to the device and use the show version command in the CLI. If the device is running Cisco IOS XR Software, Cisco IOS XR Software or similar text appears in the system banner. The location and name of the system image file that is currently running on the device appears next to the System image file is text. The name of the hardware product appears on the line after the name of the system image file.

The following example shows the output of the show version command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software release 5.3.4:
RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9001#show version
Wed Jan 24 01:32:32.751 EST    Cisco IOS XR Software, Version 5.3.4[Default]  Copyright (c) 2017 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

P4040 processor at 1500MHz, Revision 2.0  ASR-9001 Chassis    2 Management Ethernet  8 TenGigE  20 GigabitEthernet  8 DWDM controller(s)  8 WANPHY controller(s)  44 GigabitEthernet/IEEE 802.3 interface(s)  219k bytes of non-volatile configuration memory.  2880M bytes of hard disk.  3932144k bytes of disk0: (Sector size 512 bytes).    Configuration register on node 0/RSP0/CPU0 is 0x2102


Determining if the Device Has a Trident-based Line Card

The first generation of the Cisco ASR 9000 Series Ethernet line cards are often referred to as Trident-based (or Ethernet) line cards. The term comes from the Network Processors (NPs) that are used on these line cards. The following is a complete list of affected Trident-based line cards. Line cards not listed are not affected by this vulnerability:

A9K-40GE-L
A9K-40GE-B
A9K-40GE-E
A9K-4T-L
A9K-4T-B
A9K-4T-E
A9K-8T/4-L
A9K-8T/4-B
A9K-8T/4-E
A9K-2T20GE-L
A9K-2T20GE-B
A9K-2T20GE-E
A9K-8T-L
A9K-8T-B
A9K-8T-E
A9K-16/8T-B
  To determine whether the line card installed in the ASR 9000 Series Router is Trident-based, the administrator can use the show diag | include PID: command. Affected devices will include the product ID (PID) for at least one of the Trident-based line cards listed previously. The following example shows a device on which an A9K-8T-L card is active:
RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006-B#show diag | include PID:
Tue Jan 26 00:07:09.406 EST    PID:   A9K-RSP440-SE    PID:   A9K-RSP440-SE    PID:   A9K-8X100GE-SE    PID:   A9K-8T-L    PID:   A9K-36X10GE-SE    PID:   A9K-MOD160-TR    PID:   A9K-MPA-8X10GE     PID:   A9K-MPA-8X10GE   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006-B#
    For more information on Trident-based line cards, consult the ASR 9000 Series Line Card Types publication at the following URL: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/asr-9000-series-aggregation-services-routers/116726-qanda-product-00.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/asr-9000-series-aggregation-services-routers/116726-qanda-product-00.html#anc2"]

Determining if the Device Is Configured for IPv6

Administrators can use the show ipv6 interface brief command to determine if an interface is enabled for IPv6 traffic processing. The following example shows an interface configured for IPv6 processing:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router# show ipv6 interface brief
GigabitEthernet0/2/0/0 [Up/Up]  fe80::212:daff:fe62:c150  202::1  .
.
.

The show ipv6 interface brief command will produce an error message if the running version of Cisco IOS XR Software does not support IPv6. The output will not show any interfaces with IPv6 addresses if IPv6 is disabled.

An interface may be configured for IPv6 processing but may not appear on the output of the show ipv6 interface brief command if the interface is part of a bundle or a virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instance. The show ipv6 vrf all interface command can be used to determine whether any interface has been configured in this way. The following is the output of the show ipv6 vrf all interface command showing an interface configured for IPv6 processing as part of a bundle and assigned to a VRF instance:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Router#show ipv6 vrf all interface
.
.
.  Bundle-Ether4.765 is Up, ipv6 protocol is Up, Vrfid is FDA (0x60000001)    IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is fe80::21d:a2ff:aabb:ccdd    Global unicast address(es):      2001:db8:1:1::1, subnet is 2001:db8:1:1::/64     Joined group address(es): ff02::1:ff00:0 ff02::1:aabb:ccdd ff02::2        ff02::1    MTU is 1518 (1500 is available to IPv6)    ICMP redirects are disabled    ICMP unreachables are enabled    ND DAD is enabled, number of DAD attempts 1    ND reachable time is 0 milliseconds    ND advertised retransmit interval is 0 milliseconds    Hosts use stateless autoconfig for addresses.
