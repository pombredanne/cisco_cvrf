  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in local file management for certain system log files of Cisco collaboration products that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high disk utilization, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  The vulnerability occurs because a certain system log file does not have a maximum size restriction. Therefore, the file is allowed to consume the majority of available disk space on the appliance. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted remote connection requests to the appliance. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to increase the size of a system log file so that it consumes most of the disk space. The lack of available disk space could lead to a DoS condition in which the application functions could operate abnormally, making the appliance unstable.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180606-diskdos ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180606-diskdos"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2"></Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Voice Operating System (VOS)-based products:

Emergency Responder
Finesse
Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment
MediaSense
Prime License Manager

This vulnerability also affects the following Cisco products:

Prime Collaboration Assurance
Prime Collaboration Provisioning
  Determining the Current Software Release from the CLI
To determine which software release is running on a platform, administrators can issue the show version active command in the CLI.

  In the following example, the software release is 11.5.1.10000-86:


ciscocm: show version active
Active Master Version: 11.5.1.10000-86
  Determining the Current Software Release for the Cisco Unified or Contact Center Platform
Administrators can use the UI to determine which Cisco product software release is running:

Log in to the web-based interface
Choose Help &gt; About to view the system software release

Administrators can use the UI to determine which Cisco Contact Center platformâ€“based product software release is running:

Log in to the Cisco Contact Center Express server
Go to the Cisco Unified Communications operating system administration window
Choose Show &gt; Software</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.
  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:

Identity Service (IdS) 11.5 and 11.6
Prime Collaboration Deployment</Note>
    <Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the user to observe the following error in device logs:


./hssi_defines.sh: line ###: echo: write error: No space left on device

Administrators who observe this error are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to determine whether the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

    <Title>Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Emergency Responder, and Unity Connection Disk Utilization Denial of Service Vulnerability</Title>
    <ID SystemName="Cisco Bug ID">CSCvd10872</ID>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in local file management for certain system log files of Cisco collaboration products that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high disk utilization, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability occurs because a certain system log file does not have a maximum size restriction. Therefore, the file is allowed to consume the majority of available disk space on the appliance. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted remote connection requests to the appliance. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to increase the size of a system log file so that it consumes most of the disk space. The lack of available disk space could lead to a DoS condition in which the application functions could operate abnormally, making the appliance unstable.</Note>
