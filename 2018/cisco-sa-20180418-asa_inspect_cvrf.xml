    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the Application Layer Protocol Inspection feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerabilities are due to logical errors during traffic inspection. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a high volume of malicious traffic across an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a deadlock condition, resulting in a reload of an affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa_inspect ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa_inspect"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software configured for Application Layer Protocol Inspection running on the following Cisco products.

3000 Series Industrial Security Appliance (ISA)
ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances
ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls
ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers
Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)
Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliance
Firepower 4100 Series Security Appliance
Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module
FTD Virtual (FTDv)

Application Layer Protocol Inspection is enabled in Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software by default. Refer to the Cisco ASA Series Firewall CLI Configuration Guide ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa99/configuration/firewall/asa-99-firewall-config/inspect-service-policy.html#ID-2094-0000026e"] for details on the default application inspection policy.
 ASA Software Cisco ASA Software is only vulnerable if running software release 9.6 or later. Determining the Cisco ASA Software Release  To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on a device, administrators can use the show version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.7(1)4:
ciscoasa# show version | include Version
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.7(1)4  Firepower Extensible Operating System Version 2.1(1.66)  Baseboard Management Controller (revision 0x1) Firmware Version: 2.4
    Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window. FTD Software Cisco FTD Software is only vulnerable if running software release 6.1.0 or later. Determining the Cisco FTD Software Release
To determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the show version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.2:


&gt; show version
  ------------------[ ftd ]-----------------------
Model : Cisco Firepower 2130 Threat Defense (77) Version 6.2.2 (Build 81)
UUID : 0cd3595a-7efa-11e7-aaa1-ee3989c8bf25
Rules update version : 2017-12-20-001-vrt
VDB version : 290
----------------------------------------------------</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Fixed Releases  Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the table(s) in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:

      cisco-sa-20180418-asa1 ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa1"]: Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance SSL Certificate Bypass Vulnerability
