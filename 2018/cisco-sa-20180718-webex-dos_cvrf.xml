    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing a user with a malicious .arf or .wrf file via email or URL and convincing the user to launch the file in the Webex recording players. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause an affected player to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The Cisco Webex players are applications that are used to play back Webex meetings that have been recorded by an online meeting attendee. The Webex Network Recording Player for .arf files can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording that is hosted on a Webex server. The Webex Player for .wrf files can be downloaded manually.


There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180718-webex-dos ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180718-webex-dos"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect ARF and WRF recording players available from Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites, Cisco Webex Meetings Online sites, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server. For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.

  To determine which version of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player (for .arf files) or the Cisco Webex Player (for .wrf files) is installed, users can open the player and select the Help &gt; About menu.

Note: Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco Webex Meetings that have reached end of software maintenance and should contact customer support.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Cisco Webex Meetings Suite services and Cisco WebEx Meetings Online are hosted multimedia conferencing solutions that are managed and maintained by Cisco Webex. Cisco Webex Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers can host in their private clouds.

Cisco Webex Meetings services can be configured to allow recording of a meeting that is stored online and can be downloaded by a user in ARF format. These services can also record meetings directly on local computers in WRF format. The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player plays .arf files and the Cisco Webex Player plays .wrf files.

The Network Recording Player can be automatically installed when a user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a Cisco Webex Meetings Suite site (for streaming playback mode). The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player can also be installed manually. The Cisco Webex Player can only be manually installed from the Webex site.

The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for .arf files is available for Cisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS31, WBS32, WBS33), Cisco Webex Meetings Online, and for Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The Cisco Webex Player for .wrf files is only available for Cisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS31, WBS32, and WBS33) and Cisco Webex Meetings Online. The Cisco Webex Player for .wrf files is not available for Cisco Webex Meetings Server.

The vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player. Windows, OS X, and Linux versions of the players are all affected by at least one vulnerability described in this advisory.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, it is possible to remove the affected Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player by following the uninstall procedure for the operating system. For example, in Windows, use Add or Remove Programs to uninstall the affected players.

  To remove Webex software completely from a system, use the Meeting Services Removal Tool (for Microsoft Windows users) or Mac Webex Meeting Application Uninstaller (for Apple Mac OS X users), available for download from the Cisco Collaboration Help article Cisco WebEx and 3rd Party Support Utilities ["https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX000026396"].

Removal of the Webex software from a Linux or UNIX-based system can be accomplished by following the steps in the Cisco Collaboration Help article How Do I Uninstall WebEx Software on a Linux or Unix Based System? ["https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX28548"].</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerability Policy" Type="General" Ordinal="7">To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the Security Vulnerability Policy ["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/psirt/security_vulnerability_policy.html"]. This document also contains instructions for obtaining fixed software and receiving security vulnerability information from Cisco.</Note>
