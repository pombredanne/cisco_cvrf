  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">On January 3, 2018, researchers disclosed three vulnerabilities that take advantage of the implementation of speculative execution of instructions on many modern microprocessor architectures to perform side-channel information disclosure attacks. These vulnerabilities could allow an unprivileged local attacker, in specific circumstances, to read privileged memory belonging to other processes or memory allocated to  the operating system kernel.

The first two vulnerabilities, CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715,  are collectively known as Spectre. The third vulnerability, CVE-2017-5754, is known as Meltdown. The vulnerabilities are all variants of the same attack and differ in the way that speculative execution is exploited.

To exploit any of these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be able to run crafted code on an affected device. Although the underlying CPU and operating system combination in a product or service may be affected by these vulnerabilities, the majority of Cisco products are closed systems that do not allow customers to run custom code and are, therefore, not vulnerable. There is no vector to exploit them. Cisco products are considered potentially vulnerable only if they allow customers to execute custom code side-by-side with Cisco code on the same microprocessor.

A Cisco product that may be deployed as a virtual machine or a container, even while not directly affected by any of these vulnerabilities, could be targeted by such attacks if the hosting environment is vulnerable. Cisco recommends that customers harden their virtual environments, tightly control user access, and ensure that all security updates are installed. Customers who are deploying products as a virtual device in multi-tenant hosting environments should ensure that the underlying hardware, as well as operating system or hypervisor, is patched against the vulnerabilities in question.

Although Cisco cloud services are not directly affected by these vulnerabilities, the infrastructure on which they run may be impacted. Refer to the “Affected Products” section of this advisory for information about the impact of these vulnerabilities on Cisco cloud services.

Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180104-cpusidechannel ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180104-cpusidechannel"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco is investigating its product line to determine which products and cloud services may be affected by these vulnerabilities. As the investigation progresses, Cisco will update this advisory with information about affected products and services, including the Cisco bug ID for each affected product or service.

Any product or service not listed in the “Products Under Investigation” or “Vulnerable Products” section of this advisory is to be considered not vulnerable. The criteria for considering whether a product is vulnerable is explained in the “Summary” section of this advisory. Because this is an ongoing investigation, please be aware that products and services currently considered not vulnerable may subsequently be considered vulnerable as additional information becomes available.

Products Under Investigation
No products are currently under active investigation to determine whether they are affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.</Note>

    <Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.

Modern CPU Process Prediction Information Disclosure Vulnerability

A vulnerability due to the design of most modern CPUs could allow a local attacker to access sensitive information on a targeted system.

The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the speculative execution of instructions by the affected software. This vulnerability can by triggered by utilizing branch target injection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code and performing a side-channel attack on a targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read sensitive memory information.

This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-5715

Modern CPU Process Branch Prediction Information Disclosure Vulnerability

A vulnerability due to the design of most modern CPUs could allow a local attacker to access sensitive information on a targeted system.

The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the speculative execution of instructions by the affected software. This vulnerability can by triggered by performing a bounds check bypass. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code and performing a side-channel attack on a targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read sensitive memory information.

This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-5753

Intel CPU Indirect Branch Prediction Information Disclosure Vulnerability

A vulnerability in Intel CPU hardware could allow a local attacker to gain access to sensitive information on a targeted system.

The vulnerability is due to side-channel attacks, which are also referred to as Meltdown attacks. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code on the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information on the targeted system, including accessing memory from the CPU cache.

This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-5754</Note>

  <Vulnerability Ordinal="1" xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/ns/csaf-cvrf/v1.2/vuln">
    <Title>Intel CPU Indirect Branch Prediction Information Disclosure Vulnerability</Title>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Intel CPU hardware could allow a local attacker to gain access to sensitive information on a targeted system.



The vulnerability is due to side-channel attacks, which are also referred to as Meltdown attacks. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code on the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information on the targeted system, including accessing memory from the CPU cache.</Note>

  <Vulnerability Ordinal="2" xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/ns/csaf-cvrf/v1.2/vuln">
    <Title>Modern CPU Process Branch Prediction Information Disclosure Vulnerability</Title>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability due to the design of most modern CPUs could allow a local attacker to access sensitive information on a targeted system.



The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the speculative execution of instructions by the affected software. This vulnerability can by triggered by performing a bounds check bypass. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code and performing a side-channel attack on a targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read sensitive memory information.</Note>
