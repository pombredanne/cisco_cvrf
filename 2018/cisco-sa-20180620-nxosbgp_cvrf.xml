    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) implementation of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the device unexpectedly reloading.

The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the BGP update messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP update message to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to reload unexpectedly.

The Cisco implementation of the BGP protocol only accepts incoming BGP traffic from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer or inject malformed messages into the victim's BGP network. This would require obtaining information about the BGP peers in the affected system's trusted network.

The vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a malformed BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. At least one BGP neighbor session must be established for a router to be vulnerable.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is part of the June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection, which includes 24 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 24 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-67770"].</Note>
    <Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2" />
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software:

Nexus 2000 Series Switches
Nexus 3000 Series Switches
Nexus 3500 Platform Switches
Nexus 3600 Platform Switches
Nexus 5500 Platform Switches
Nexus 5600 Platform Switches
Nexus 6000 Series Switches
Nexus 7000 Series Switches
Nexus 7700 Series Switches
Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode
Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode
Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules

For information about which Cisco NX-OS Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.
  Determining if the NX-OS Software Is Vulnerable

The vulnerability affects only NX-OS devices configured with BGP functionality. In addition, the device needs to have at least one BGP neighbor (peer) configured. The potentially malicious BGP peer needs to be configured on the NX-OS device as a BGP neighbor. This vulnerability applies to BGP traffic destined for the device. The device processes BGP packets on TCP port 179 on IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6).

To determine whether a Nexus device is configured with the BGP feature and a BGP neighbor, administrators can use the show running-config | include "router bgp" and show running-config | include "neighbor" commands from the NX-OS CLI and verify that the feature is enabled.

The following example shows the BGP feature enabled with one BGP neighbor on a device running NX-OS Software:

nxos-switch# show running-config | include "router bgp"
router bgp 64512
nxos-switch# show running-config | include "neighbor"  neighbor 209.165.201.1 remote-as 64497
    Determining the Cisco NX-OS Software Release
Administrators can check the release of Cisco NX-OS Software that is running on a device by using the show version command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of this command on a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.3(2)D1(1):


nxos-switch# show version

    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However,    BGP Neighbor Authentication with MD5 can help to ensure that the configured BGP peer is not spoofed.

Configuring    BGP Neighbor Authentication with MD5

BGP can be configured to authenticate route updates from peers using MD5 digests. To configure BGP to use MD5 authentication, use the following commands in the neighbor configuration mode CLI:
switch(config)# router bgp 65536
switch(config-router-neighbor)# password BGPpassword

Please refer to the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/5_x/nx-os/unicast/configuration/guide/l3_cli_nxos/l3_advbgp.html"] for additional information.</Note>

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer or inject malformed messages into the victim's BGP network. This would require obtaining information about the BGP peers in the affected system's trusted network.



The vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a malformed BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. At least one BGP neighbor session must be established for a router to be vulnerable.</Note>

        <Description>There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However,    BGP Neighbor Authentication with MD5 can help to ensure that the configured BGP peer is not spoofed.

Configuring    BGP Neighbor Authentication with MD5

BGP can be configured to authenticate route updates from peers using MD5 digests. To configure BGP to use MD5 authentication, use the following commands in the neighbor configuration mode CLI:
switch(config)# router bgp 65536
switch(config-router-neighbor)# password BGPpassword
