    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco UCS Central Software could allow a remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected interface or hijack a valid session ID from a user of the affected interface.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the “Details” section of this security advisory.

There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171129-ucs-central ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171129-ucs-central"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect all releases of Cisco UCS Central Software prior to the first fixed release. For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug IDs at the top of this advisory.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</Note>
    <Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Two vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco UCS Central Software could allow a remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected interface or hijack a valid session ID from a user of the affected interface.

The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.
  Cisco UCS Central Software Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco UCS Central Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the web-based management interface of the affected software.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the affected interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information on the user’s system.

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials for and authenticate to the affected software.

This vulnerability cannot be exploited to run persistent scripts in the web-based management interface of the affected software and, therefore, cannot be leveraged to affect users other than the targeted user.

The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2017-12348

The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: Medium
  Cisco UCS Central Software Session Fixation Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the session management functionality of the web-based management interface of Cisco UCS Central Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack a valid session ID from a user of the web-based management interface of the affected software.

The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not assign a new session ID to a user session when a user authenticates to the software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a hijacked session ID to connect to the affected software through the web-based management interface of the software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated user’s browser session.

The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2017-12349

The SIR for this vulnerability is: Medium</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug IDs at the top of this advisory.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerability Policy" Type="General" Ordinal="7">To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the Security Vulnerability Policy ["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/psirt/security_vulnerability_policy.html"]. This document also contains instructions for obtaining fixed software and receiving security vulnerability information from Cisco.</Note>
    <Note Title="Exploitation and Public Announcements" Type="General" Ordinal="8">The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.</Note>
    <Note Title="Source" Type="General" Ordinal="9">Cisco would like to thank Application Security Consultant Indrajith.A.N for reporting these vulnerabilities.</Note>
