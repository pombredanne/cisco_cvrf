    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) Software could allow a remote attacker to inject arbitrary values into DCNM configuration parameters, redirect a user to a malicious website, inject malicious content into a DCNM client interface, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the “Details” section of this security advisory.

There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171129-dcnm ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171129-dcnm"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect all releases of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) Software prior to the first fixed release. For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug IDs at the top of this advisory.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</Note>
    <Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Five vulnerabilities in Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) Software could allow a remote attacker to inject arbitrary values into DCNM configuration parameters, redirect a user to a malicious website, inject malicious content into a DCNM client interface, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software.

The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.
  Cisco Data Center Network Manager Bypass Client-Side Validation Parameters Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco DCNM Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary values into DCNM configuration parameters for an affected system.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient server-side validation of user-supplied data in HTTP payloads that are sent to the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by bypassing server-side protections and injecting arbitrary values into certain configuration parameters for the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary values into DCNM configuration parameters.

The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2017-12343

The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: Medium
  Cisco Data Center Network Manager HTTP Header Injection Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco DCNM Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user of the affected interface to a malicious, attacker-controlled website.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of values in HTTP header parameters that are sent to the web interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link and injecting malicious HTTP headers into HTTP messages that are sent to or from the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect a user of the affected software to a malicious, attacker-controlled website.

The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2017-12344

The SIR for this vulnerability is: Medium
  Cisco Data Center Network Manager Content Spoofing Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco DCNM Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject malicious content into the content that is displayed by the affected interface.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied values in HTTP parameters that are sent to the web interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious HTTP parameter values into HTTP messages that are sent to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject malicious content into the content that is displayed by the web interface of the affected software, which could allow the attacker to persuade a user to follow malicious instructions or click a malicious link.

The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2017-12345

The SIR for this vulnerability is: Medium
  Cisco Data Center Network Manager Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco DCNM Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack against a user of the affected interface, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code or access sensitive browser-based information.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the affected interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information on the user’s system.

The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2017-12346

The SIR for this vulnerability is: Medium
  Cisco Data Center Network Manager Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco DCNM Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected XSS attack against a user of the affected interface, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code or access sensitive browser-based information.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the affected interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information on the user’s system.

The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2017-12347

The SIR for this vulnerability is: Medium</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug IDs at the top of this advisory.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
