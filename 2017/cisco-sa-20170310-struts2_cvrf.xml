    <Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">A vulnerability in the Jakarta multipart parser of Apache Struts could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.

The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the Content-Type header value when performing a file upload based on the Jakarta multipart parser of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a targeted user to upload a malicious file. Once the Jakarta multipart parser of the affected application uploads the file, the attacker could have the ability to execute arbitrary code.</Note>
    <Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="6">To help detect exploitation of this vulnerability, Cisco has released Cisco IPS Signature Sig-ID 7872-0 ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewIpsSignature.x?signatureId=7872&amp;signatureSubId=0&amp;softwareVersion=6.0&amp;releaseVersion=S969"] and Snort SIDs 41818, 41819, 41923, and 41922.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="7">Any workarounds, if available, are documented in the Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"].</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="8">When Cisco releases free software updates, customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html ["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

    <Title>Apache Struts Jakarta Multipart Parser File Upload Code Execution Vulnerability</Title>
    <ID SystemName="Cisco Bug ID">CSCvd51442</ID>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Jakarta multipart parser of Apache Struts could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the Content-Type header value when performing a file upload based on the Jakarta multipart parser of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a targeted user to upload a malicious file. Once the Jakarta multipart parser of the affected application uploads the file, the attacker could have the ability to execute arbitrary code.</Note>
