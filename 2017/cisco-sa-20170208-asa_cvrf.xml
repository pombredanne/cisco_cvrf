    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Common Internet Filesystem (CIFS) code in the
Clientless SSL VPN functionality of Cisco ASA Software could allow an
authenticated, remote attacker to cause a heap overflow.



The
vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user supplied input. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL to the affected
system. An exploit could allow the remote attacker to cause a reload of the
affected system or potentially execute code.



Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can
be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects
systems configured in routed firewall mode only and in single or
multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 or
IPv6 traffic. A valid TCP connection is needed to perform the attack. The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the Clientless SSL VPN portal.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.
This advisory is available at the following link:

https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170208-asa["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170208-asa"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Vulnerable Cisco ASA Software running on the following products may be affected by this vulnerability:


    Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances 
    Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls
    Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv) 
    Cisco ASA for Firepower 9300 Series 
    Cisco ASA for Firepower 4100 Series 
    Cisco ISA 3000 Industrial Security Appliance 

Refer to the "Fixed Software" section of this security advisory for more information about the affected releases.</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">
Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the Clientless SSL VPN portal is enabled. To determine whether the Clientless SSL VPN portal is enabled, the administrator can verify the following:


    webvpn is enabled on at least one interface.
    The group policy includes the ssl-clientless option configured in the vpn-tunnel-protocol command.

To determine whether webvpn is enabled, use the show running-config webvpn
command.
The following example shows a Cisco ASA with the Clientless SSL VPN portal enabled on the outside interface:

ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn 
webvpn
 enable outside
 [...]


To determine whether the ssl-clientless option is configured in the vpn-tunnel-protocol command, use the  show running-config group-policy  attributes | include vpn-tunnel-protocol command. The following example shows a policy called Clientless with ssl-clientless option configured the vpn-tunnel-protocol command.


ciscoasa# show running-config group-policy Clientless attributes | include vpn-tunnel-protocol
vpn-tunnel-protocol ssl-client ssl-clientless

If the vpn-tunnel-protocol command options are not specified in the group policy, Cisco ASA inherits the options from the default group policy called DfltGrpPolicy. By default, the DfltGrpPolicy has the ssl-clientless option enabled.



Note: Cisco ASA configured with a Cisco AnyConnect Essential license is not affected by this vulnerability. 

Determining the Running Software Version
To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can use the show version command. The following example shows the results of the show version command on an appliance running Cisco ASA Software version 9.2(1):

ciscoasa# show version | include Version
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.2(1) 
Device Manager Version 7.4(1)
Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software version in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software is not affected by this vulnerability.



No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">It is possible to block the offending URL using a webtype access list, which can be performed using the following steps:


    Configure the webtype access list:
    
    access-list bugCSCvc23838 webtype deny url https://*/+webvpn+/CIFS_R/*
access-list bugCSCvc23838 webtype permit url https://*
access-list bugCSCvc23838 webtype permit url cifs://*
    
    The second and third access-list will allow any other HTTPS and CIFS traffic. Administrator should review their configuration and adapt this access list based on their access policy.

    

    Apply the access list in the group policy with the filter value  command:
    
    group-policy Clientless attributes
 webvpn
  filter value bugCSCvc23838
