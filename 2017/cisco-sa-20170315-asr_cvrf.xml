    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A privilege escalation vulnerability in the Secure Shell (SSH) subsystem in the StarOS operating system for Cisco ASR 5000 Series, ASR 5500 Series, ASR 5700 Series devices, and Cisco Virtualized Packet Core could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unrestricted, root shell access.

The vulnerability is due to missing input validation of parameters passed during SSH or SFTP login. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted user input to the SSH or SFTP command-line interface (CLI) during SSH or SFTP login. An exploit could allow an authenticated attacker to gain root privileges access on the router.

Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be triggered via both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. An established TCP connection toward port 22, the SSH default port, is needed to perform the attack. The attacker must have valid credentials to login to the system via SSH or SFTP.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170315-asr ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170315-asr"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following products have been confirmed to be vulnerable:

Cisco ASR 5000/5500/5700 Series devices running StarOS after 17.7.0 and prior to 18.7.4, 19.5, and 20.2.3 with SSH configured are vulnerable.
Cisco Virtualized Packet Core - Single Instance (VPC-SI) and Distributed Instance (VPC-DI) devices running StarOS prior to N4.2.7 (19.3.v7) and N4.7 (20.2.v0) with SSH configured are vulnerable.
  To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco StarOS is running on ASR 5000/5500/5700 Series devices, administrators can issue the show version command from the CLI. The following output is an example of a router that is running StarOS version 19.2.1.
[local]ASR-2# show version
Friday August 12 13:17:31 AST 2016
Active Software:
  Image Version:                  19.2.1
  Image Build Number:             62564
  Image Description:              Deployment_Build
  Image Date:                     Thu Dec 31 20:13:39 EST 2015
  Boot Image:                     /flash/asr5500-19.2.1.bin
Similarly, administrators can issue the show version command from the CLI to determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco StarOS is running on a vPC-SI or vPC-DI instance. The following output is an example of a vPC instance that is running StarOS version N4.6 (20.1.v0):
[local]vPC-DI# show version
Active Software:
 Image Version:                  20.1.v0
 Image Build Number:             64657
 Image Description:              Deployment_Build
 Image Date:                     Wed Jul 27 18:46:53 EDT 2016
 Boot Image:                     /flash/qvpc-di-20.1.v0.bin
To determine whether SSH is configured on Cisco StarOS or Cisco vPC software, administrators can issue the show configuration | grep sshd command from the CLI. In the following example, the presence of the server sshd line shows that the SSH server is enabled:
[local]ASR-2# show configuration | grep sshd
    server sshd</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products:

Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC)
Cisco Ultra Automation Services (UAS)
  No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Successful exploitation of this vulnerability causes CLI logs to show a CLI session starting for the compromised user and the same CLI session ending within a few milliseconds. Administrators can view CLI logs by using the show logs facility cli command. In the following example, the user inspector exploited this vulnerability.
[local]ASR-2# show logs facility cli
2017-Feb-01+13:33:08.477 [cli 30005 info] [6/0/14607 &lt;cli:6014607&gt; _commands_cli.c:1775] [software internal system syslog] CLI session ended for Inspector inspector on device
2017-Feb-01+13:33:08.455 [cli 30004 info] [6/0/14607 &lt;cli:6014607&gt; cli_sess.c:127] [software internal system syslog] CLI session started for Inspector inspector on device  from 10.X.X.X

    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Administrators can restrict access to the management interface, (for example, by applying an access control list (ACL)), to limit the attack surface.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html ["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
