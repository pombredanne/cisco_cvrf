  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the CLI parser of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform command injection and elevate privileges to root. The attacker must authenticate with valid operator-level or administrator-level credentials.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the CLI parser. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device and performing command injection over the CLI. An exploit could allow the attacker to escape from the CLI  subshell and execute system-level commands on the underlying operating system as root.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
