    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and WebEx Recording Format (WRF) files. A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing a user with a malicious ARF or WRF file via email or URL and convincing the user to launch the file. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause an affected player to crash and, in some cases, could allow arbitrary code execution on the system of a targeted user.

The Cisco WebEx players are applications that are used to play back WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded by an online meeting attendee. The player can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx server.

Cisco has updated affected versions of the Cisco WebEx Business Suite meeting sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings Server, and Cisco WebEx ARF and WRF Players to address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171129-webex-players ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171129-webex-players"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco WebEx ARF Player and the Cisco WebEx WRF Player. The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS30, WBS 31, and WBS32), Cisco WebEx Meetings, and Cisco WebEx Meetings Server are affected by at least one of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:

Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS30) client builds prior to T30.20
Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31) client builds prior to T31.20
Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS32) client builds prior to T32.7
Cisco WebEx Meetings with client builds prior to T32.7
Cisco WebEx Meeting Server builds prior to 2.7MR3
  To determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the Support &gt; Downloads section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under About Meeting Center. See the “Fixed Software” section for details.

Alternatively, version information of the Cisco WebEx meeting client can be accessed from within the Cisco WebEx meeting client. Version information for the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Windows and Linux platforms can be viewed by choosing Help &gt; About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center. Version information for the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Mac platforms can be viewed by choosing Meeting Center &gt; About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center.

The Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 30.32.16 is fixed, build 30.32.17 will contain updated software. Cisco WebEx site administrators have access to secondary version nomenclature, for example, T30 SP32 EP 16, which shows that the server is running client build 30.32.16.

Note: Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco WebEx that have reached end of software maintenance and should contact customer support.</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</Note>
    <Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS) meeting services and Cisco WebEx Meetings are a hosted multimedia conferencing solution that is managed and maintained by Cisco WebEx. The Cisco WebEx Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customer can host in their private clouds.

The ARF and WRF file formats are used to store WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site, or on the computer of an online meeting attendee.

The Cisco WebEx ARF Player and the Cisco WebEx WRF Player are applications that are used to play back and edit WebEx ARF and WRF recording files (files with .arf and .wrf extensions).

The Cisco WebEx ARF Player and Cisco WebEx WRF Player can be automatically installed when a user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site (for streaming playback mode). The Cisco WebEx ARF Player and Cisco WebEx WRF Player can also be manually installed after downloading the application from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html ["https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"] to play back recording files for offline playback.

The Cisco WebEx ARF Player is available for all Cisco WebEx meeting site clients (WBS30, WBS31, WBS32, and WebEx Meetings) and for Cisco WebEx Meetings Server clients. The Cisco WebEx WRF Player is only available for Cisco WebEx WBS30, WBS 31, and WBS32 meeting site clients and is not available for the Cisco WebEx Meetings or Cisco WebEx Meetings Server clients.

The following table provides the Cisco bug IDs and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers that have been assigned for the vulnerabilities in this advisory:

                              Title              CVE ID              Cisco Bug ID                                  Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player Denial of Service Vulnerability               CVE-2017-12367              CSCve11545, CSCve02843, CSCve11548
                                  Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player Remote Code Execution Vulnerability               CVE-2017-12368              CSCve10584, CSCve10591, CSCve11503, CSCve10658, CSCve11507, CSCve10749, CSCve10744, CSCve11532, CSCve10762, CSCve10764, CSCve11538                                  Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player Out-of-Bounds Vulnerability               CVE-2017-12369              CSCve30208, CSCve30214, CSCve30268                                  Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player Remote Code Execution Vulnerability               CVE-2017-12370              CSCvf38060, CSCvg54836, CSCvf38077, CSCvg54843, CSCvf38084, CSCvg54850                                  Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player Remote Code Execution Vulnerability               CVE-2017-12371              CSCvf49650, CSCvg54853, CSCvg54856, CSCvf49697, CSCvg54861, CSCvf49707, CSCvg54867                                  Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player Remote Code Execution Vulnerability               CVE-2017-12372              CSCvf57234, CSCvg54868, CSCvg54870
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may cause player applications to crash or, in some cases, execute malicious code from a remote attacker.

To exploit these vulnerabilities, the player application would need to open a malicious ARF or WRF file. An attacker may be able to accomplish this exploit by providing the malicious recording file directly to users (for example, by using email), or by directing a user to a malicious web page. The vulnerabilities cannot be triggered by users who are attending a WebEx meeting.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, it is possible to remove all WebEx software completely from a system using the Meeting Services Removal Tool (for Microsoft Windows users) or Mac WebEx Meeting Application Uninstaller (for Apple Mac OS X users) available for download from the Cisco Collaboration Help for Cisco Spark, WebEx, and Jabber article at https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX000026396 ["https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX000026396"].

The Cisco WebEx Players are applications that are used to play back WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded by an online meeting attendee. The player can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx server.



Cisco has updated affected version of the Cisco WebEx Business Suite meeting sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings Server, and Cisco WebEx ARF and WRF players to address these vulnerabilities.</Note>
