    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco Registered Envelope Service could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to a undesired web page.

The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters of the HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting an HTTP request that could cause the web application to redirect the request to a specified malicious URL. This type of exploit is known as an open redirect attack and is used in phishing attacks to get users to visit malicious sites without their knowledge.
