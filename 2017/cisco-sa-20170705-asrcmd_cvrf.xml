    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the CLI command-parsing code of the Cisco StarOS operating system for Cisco ASR 5000 Series, 5500 Series, and 5700 Series devices and Cisco Virtualized Packet Core (VPC) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to break from the StarOS CLI of an affected system and execute arbitrary shell commands as a Linux root user on the system.

The vulnerability exists because the affected operating system does not sufficiently sanitize commands before inserting them into Linux shell commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted CLI command for execution in a Linux shell command as a root user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to break from the StarOS CLI and execute arbitrary commands on the affected system as a Linux root user.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170705-asrcmd ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170705-asrcmd"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running the Cisco StarOS operating system:

ASR 5000 Series
ASR 5500 Series
ASR 5700 Series
Virtualized Packet Core-Distributed Instance (VPC-DI) Software
Virtualized Packet Core-Single Instance (VPC-SI) Software

To determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco StarOS is running on a Cisco ASR 5000 Series, 5500 Series, or 5700 Series device, administrators can issue the show version command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a Cisco ASR 5500 Series Router that is running Cisco StarOS Release 19.2.1:


[local]ASR-2# show version

Active Software:
  Image Version:                  19.2.1

  Boot Image:                     /flash/asr5500-19.2.1.bin

To determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco StarOS is running on a VPC-SI or VPC-DI instance, administrators can issue the show version command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a VPC-DI instance that is running Cisco StarOS Release 20.1.v0 (VPC-DI Release N4.6):


[local]VPC-DI# show version

    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC) or Cisco Ultra Automation Services (UAS).</Note>
    <Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker could use one of several Cisco StarOS CLI commands. However, the attacker must first authenticate successfully to an affected device as a non-administrative user via the console or Secure Shell (SSH). To authenticate successfully, the attacker may use an existing, compromised, non-administrative user account for the device.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html ["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
