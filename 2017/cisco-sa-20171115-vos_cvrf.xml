    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the upgrade mechanism of Cisco collaboration products based on the Cisco Voice Operating System software platform could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized, elevated access to an affected device.

The vulnerability occurs when a refresh upgrade or Prime Collaboration Deployment (PCD) migration is performed on an affected device. When a refresh upgrade or PCD migration is completed successfully, an engineering flag remains enabled and could allow root access to the device with a known password.

If the vulnerable device is subsequently upgraded using the standard upgrade method to an Engineering Special Release, service update, or a new major release of the affected product, this vulnerability is remediated by that action.

Note: Engineering Special Releases that are installed as COP files, as opposed to the standard upgrade method, do not remediate this vulnerability.

An attacker who can access an affected device over SFTP while it is in a vulnerable state could gain root access to the device. This access could allow the attacker to compromise the affected system completely.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171115-vos ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171115-vos"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Voice Operating System (VOS)–based products when they have been upgraded by using the refresh upgrade (RU) method or migrated by using the Prime Collaboration Deployment (PCD) method:

Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM)
Cisco Unified Communication Manager Session Management Edition (SME)
Cisco Emergency Responder
Cisco Unity Connection
Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service (IM&amp;P; earlier releases were known as Cisco Unified Presence)
Cisco Prime License Manager
Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment
Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (UCCx)
Cisco SocialMiner
Cisco Unified Intelligence Center (UIC)
Cisco Finesse
Cisco MediaSense
  The PCD migration method affects only Cisco UCM, SME, and IM&amp;P.
Determining the Upgrade or Migration Method  The Cisco VOS-based products identified in the preceding vulnerable products list are affected by this vulnerability if they were refresh upgraded or migrated by using the PCD methods. Note that a VOS-based product must go through a refresh upgrade if the underlying operating system is also being upgraded to a new major release.

If the VOS-based product was standard upgraded to an Engineering Special, service update, or a new major release of the affected product that does not require major upgrades to the underlying operating system, this vulnerability will be remediated by that standard upgrade action.

Refresh Upgrade Method Verification

To verify whether the product has been exposed to the vulnerability by the refresh upgrade method, issue the following command at the CLI to view the system-history.log file:
admin: file view install system-history.log

The following example shows a refresh upgrade entry in the system-history.log file:
02/28/2013 14:56:05 | root: Upgrade (refresh) 10.0.0.97016-27 Success

The following example shows a standard upgrade entry in the system-history.log file:
10/13/2017 18:56:07 | root: Upgrade 12.0.1.20000-3 Success

PCD Migration Method Verification

To verify whether the product has been exposed to this vulnerability by the PCD migration method, issue the following command at the CLI to view the install.log file:
admin: file view install install.log

The following example shows a PCD migration log entry in the install.log file:
10/16/2017 13:59:13 post_install|Starting post_install processing - VOS_INSTALL_CONTEXT = M1|

The following example shows a normal fresh install log entry in the install.log file:
08/15/2011 08:56:03 post_install|Starting post_install processing - VOS_INSTALL_CONTEXT = install|

Underlying Operating System Upgraded to a New Major Release

A VOS-based product will undergo a refresh upgrade if the underlying operating system is also upgraded to a new major release.

The following examples show major operating system releases that are associated with major affected product releases:

                              Cisco  UCM, Cisco Unity Connection, and Cisco Unified Presence Server/Cisco IM&amp;P  Major Release              Operating System Major Release                                  8.6              RHEL 5 Update 5                                  9.x              RHEL 5 Update 7                                  10.x              RHEL 6 Update 2                                  11.x              RHEL 6 Update 5                                  12.x              CentOS 6 Update 6
Because an upgrade from RHEL 6 to CentOS 6 is not considered a major operating system release change, product updates between these operating system releases will use the standard upgrade method.

Prime Collaboration Deployment Cluster Migration

Prime Collaboration Deployment is a free application that is designed to assist in the management of various Cisco Unified Communications applications. The PCD migrate cluster task is supported only for the following Cisco products and to only certain cluster migration destination versions.

UCM destination version 10.x, 11.0(1), 11.5(x), 12.0(1)
IM&amp;P destination version 10.x, 11.0(1), 11.5(x), 12.0(1)
Refer to the product documentation for information about specific upgrade and migration methods.  Determining the Current Software Release for the Cisco Unified Platform  The following Cisco products run on the Cisco Unified platform:

Unified Communications Manager
Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition
Emergency Responder
Unity Connection
Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service
Prime License Manager
Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment
To determine which Cisco VOS-based product software release is running on the Cisco Unified platform, an administrator can issue the show version active command at the CLI.

In the following example, the software release is 11.5.1.10000-86.
ciscocm: show version active
Active Master Version: 11.5.1.10000-86

An administrator can use the user interface to determine which Cisco VOS-based product software release is running:

Log in to the web-based interface
Click the Help menu
Click About to view the system software release
Determining the Current Software Release for the Cisco Contact Center Platform  The following Cisco products run on the Cisco Contact Center platform:
Unified Contact Center Express
SocialMiner
Unified Intelligence Center
Finesse
MediaSense
To determine which Cisco VOS-based product software release is running on the Contact Center platform, an administrator can issue the show version active command at the CLI.

In the following example, the software release is 11.5.1.10000-86.
admin: show version active
Active Master Version: 11.5.1.10000-86

An administrator can use the user interface to determine which Cisco Contact Center platform–based product software release is running:

Log in to the Contact Center Express server
Go to the Cisco Unified Communications operating system administration window
Choose Show &gt; Software</Note>

    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the upgrade mechanism of Cisco collaboration products based on the Cisco Voice Operating System software platform could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized, elevated access to an affected device.



The vulnerability occurs when a refresh upgrade or Prime Collaboration Deployment (PCD) migration is performed on an affected device. When a refresh upgrade or PCD migration is completed successfully, an engineering flag remains enabled and could allow root access to the device with a known password.



If the vulnerable device is subsequently upgraded using the standard upgrade method to an Engineering Special Release, service update, or a new major release of the affected product, this vulnerability is remediated by that action.



Note: Engineering Special Releases that are installed as COP files, as opposed to the standard upgrade method, do not remediate this vulnerability.



An attacker who can access an affected device over SFTP while it is in a vulnerable state could gain root access to the device. This access could allow the attacker to compromise the affected system completely.</Note>
