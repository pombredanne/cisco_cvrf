  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">On October 16, 2017, a research paper with the title “Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2” was made publicly available. This paper discusses seven vulnerabilities affecting session key negotiation in both the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) protocols. These vulnerabilities may allow the reinstallation of a pairwise transient key, a group key, or an integrity key on either a wireless client or a wireless access point. Additional research also led to the discovery of three additional vulnerabilities (not discussed in the original paper) affecting wireless supplicant supporting either the 802.11z (Extensions to Direct-Link Setup) standard or the 802.11v (Wireless Network Management) standard. The three additional vulnerabilities could also allow the reinstallation of a pairwise key, group key, or integrity group key.

Among these ten vulnerabilities, only one (CVE-2017-13082) may affect components of the wireless infrastructure (for example, Access Points), while the other nine vulnerabilities may affect only client devices.

Multiple Cisco wireless products are affected by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are workarounds that addresses the vulnerabilities in CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13079, CVE-2017-13080, CVE-2017-13081, and CVE-2017-13082. There are no workarounds for CVE-2017-13086, CVE-2017-13087, and CVE-2017-13088.

Assessing the Configuration of a Wireless Deployment for CVE-2017-13082
The vulnerability identified by CVE ID CVE-2017-13082 may affect only deployments that support the fast BSS transition (FT) feature and have it enabled.
  To determine whether the FT feature is enabled on a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) device, administrators can log in to the device and use the show wlan command or the show wlan id command, depending on the device model.

The following example shows the output of the show wlan id command for a Cisco 3500 Series Wireless Controllers device where FT is enabled on wlan 1:

(w-3504-2)&gt; show wlan 1
...  Security     802.11 Authentication:........................ Open System     FT Support.................................... Enabled    ...
  The following example shows the output of the show wlan id 1 command for a Cisco 5760 Series Wireless LAN Controller device where FT is disabled on wlan 1:

W-5760-2&gt; show wlan id 1 | include FT\ Support
    FT Support                                 : Disabled
    To determine whether the FT feature is enabled on a Standalone Access Point running Cisco IOS Software,  administrators can log in to the device and use the show running-config | include dot11r command and verify that the command returns output.

The following example shows the output of the show running-config | include dot11r command for an access point that has FT enabled:

AP# show running-config | include dot11r
authentication key-management wpa version 2 dot11r

    Please note that FT is not supported on deployments running a Wireless LAN Controller with AireOS version 7.0 and previous releases, hence such deployments are not affected by CVE-2017-13082.

To determine which release of Cisco WLC Software is running on a device, administrators can use the web interface or the CLI.

To use the web interface, log in to the web interface, click the Monitor tab, and then click Summary in the left pane. The Software Version field shows the release number of the software currently running on the device.

To use the CLI, issue the show sysinfo command, and then refer to the value in the Product Version field of the command output. The following example shows the output of the command for a device running Cisco WLC Software Release 8.3.102.0:

(5500-4) &gt;show sysinfo
Manufacturer's Name.............................. Cisco Systems Inc.  Product Name..................................... Cisco Controller  Product Version.................................. 8.3.102.0  Bootloader Version............................... 1.0.1  Field Recovery Image Version..................... 6.0.182.0  Firmware Version................................. FPGA 1.3, Env 1.6, USB console 1.27  Build Type....................................... DATA + WPS  .  .  .</Note>

Note: Fixes should be installed on both affected access points and wireless clients for a complete solution. Installing a fixed software release on an affected access point will fix that particular device, but will not prevent exploitation of any vulnerabilities affecting a wireless client. The converse is also true: installing a fix on a wireless client would fix that particular device, but would not prevent exploitation of any vulnerabilities affecting an access point. For a complete solution, both affected wireless access point and wireless clients should be updated, if vulnerable, to a fixed software release.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Workaround for CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13079, CVE-2017-13080, and CVE-2017-13081  Limiting the maximum number of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) over LAN (EAPoL) key retries to 0 has been determined to be a valid workaround for these vulnerabilities. Setting the EAPoL retries value to 0 means one message will be sent, there will be no retransmissions sent, and if the EAPoL timeout is exceeded the client will be removed.

This workaround can be configured at the global level or at the individual wireless LAN (WLAN) level. Please note that the option to configure this workaround at the WLAN level is only available on Cisco WLC releases 7.6 and later. Previous releases only allow configuration at the global (all WLANs) level.

In order to configure this workaround at the global level (for all WLANs), use the following command in the WLC CLI:
config advanced eap eapol-key-retries 0

    The command show advanced eap can be used to verify the configuration change is now active on the device (in bold on the following example output):

(wlc-hostname)&gt; show advanced eap
EAP-Identity-Request Timeout (seconds)........... 30  EAP-Identity-Request Max Retries................. 2  EAP Key-Index for Dynamic WEP.................... 0  EAP Max-Login Ignore Identity Response........... enable  EAP-Request Timeout (seconds).................... 30  EAP-Request Max Retries.......................... 2  EAPOL-Key Timeout (milliseconds)................. 1000  EAPOL-Key Max Retries............................ 0  EAP-Broadcast Key Interval....................... 120

In order to configure this workaround for a specific WLAN, the following two commands should be entered in the WLC CLI:
config wlan security eap-params enable WLAN-NUMBER
config wlan security eap-params eapol-key-retries 0 WLAN-NUMBER
    Both commands must be entered and WLAN-NUMBER should be replaced with the actual WLAN number. In the following example, the workaround is being implemented on WLAN number 24:
config wlan security eap-params enable 24
config wlan security eap-params eapol-key-retries 0 24

The command show wlan WLAN-NUMBER (where WLAN-NUMBER is replaced with the appropriate WLAN number) can be used then to verify the configuration change is now active on the device (in bold on the following example output):
(wlc-hostname)&gt; show wlan 24
WLAN Identifier.................................. X  Profile Name..................................... ftpsk  Network Name (SSID).............................. ftpsk  .  .  .    Tkip MIC Countermeasure Hold-down Timer....... 60    Eap-params.................................... Enabled       EAP-Identity-Request Timeout (seconds)..... 30       EAP-Identity-Request Max Retries........... 2       EAP-Request Timeout (seconds).............. 30       EAP-Request Max Retries.................... 2       EAPOL-Key Timeout (milliseconds)........... 1000       EAPOL-Key Max Retries...................... 0

Note: Implementing the previous workaround may have a negative impact on normal wireless client association to the access point in the following scenarios:

Clients that are slow or may drop initial  processing of EAPoL message number 1 (M1). This is seen on some embedded/CPU-limited clients, which may receive the M1 and not be ready to process it after the 802.1x  authentication phase.
Environments with RF (Radio Frequency) interference or a WAN connection between the access point (AP) and the WLC, which may result in packet drops at some point on transmission towards clients.
  In either scenario the outcome would be an EAPoL exchange failure and the wireless client will lose its authentication, requiring it to restart the association/authentication processes.
Workaround for CVE-2017-13082  For customers who are concerned about CVE-2017-13082 (Accepting a Retransmitted FT Reassociation Request and Reinstalling the Pairwise Key While Processing It), the workaround is as follows:

If no interactive applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or video are being used on the network, you can disable 11r support on the access point.
If VoIP applications are in use but the supplicants support CCKM (for example, Cisco Wireless Phones), you can disable 11r support and reconfigure the clients to use CCKM (Cisco Centralized Key Management), which should provide a similar roaming experience.
  Note: Disabling 11r support may have negative performance and availability impact on the network. Customers should verify that disabling 11r would not negatively impact their environment before performing such configuration change on their infrastructure devices.

No workarounds have been identified for CVE-2017-13086, CVE-2017-13087, or CVE-2017-13088. Any future workarounds that address these vulnerabilities will be documented in the respective Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"].</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">Updates for affected software releases will be published when they are available and information about those updates will be documented in Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"].
When Cisco releases software updates that address these vulnerabilities, customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.  By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html ["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

        <Description>Workaround for CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13079, CVE-2017-13080, and CVE-2017-13081  Limiting the maximum number of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) over LAN (EAPoL) key retries to 0 has been determined to be a valid workaround for these vulnerabilities. Setting the EAPoL retries value to 0 means one message will be sent, there will be no retransmissions sent, and if the EAPoL timeout is exceeded the client will be removed.

This workaround can be configured at the global level or at the individual wireless LAN (WLAN) level. Please note that the option to configure this workaround at the WLAN level is only available on Cisco WLC releases 7.6 and later. Previous releases only allow configuration at the global (all WLANs) level.

In order to configure this workaround at the global level (for all WLANs), use the following command in the WLC CLI:
config advanced eap eapol-key-retries 0

    The command show advanced eap can be used to verify the configuration change is now active on the device (in bold on the following example output):

(wlc-hostname)&gt; show advanced eap
EAP-Identity-Request Timeout (seconds)........... 30  EAP-Identity-Request Max Retries................. 2  EAP Key-Index for Dynamic WEP.................... 0  EAP Max-Login Ignore Identity Response........... enable  EAP-Request Timeout (seconds).................... 30  EAP-Request Max Retries.......................... 2  EAPOL-Key Timeout (milliseconds)................. 1000  EAPOL-Key Max Retries............................ 0  EAP-Broadcast Key Interval....................... 120

In order to configure this workaround for a specific WLAN, the following two commands should be entered in the WLC CLI:
config wlan security eap-params enable WLAN-NUMBER
config wlan security eap-params eapol-key-retries 0 WLAN-NUMBER
    Both commands must be entered and WLAN-NUMBER should be replaced with the actual WLAN number. In the following example, the workaround is being implemented on WLAN number 24:
config wlan security eap-params enable 24
config wlan security eap-params eapol-key-retries 0 24

The command show wlan WLAN-NUMBER (where WLAN-NUMBER is replaced with the appropriate WLAN number) can be used then to verify the configuration change is now active on the device (in bold on the following example output):
(wlc-hostname)&gt; show wlan 24
WLAN Identifier.................................. X  Profile Name..................................... ftpsk  Network Name (SSID).............................. ftpsk  .  .  .    Tkip MIC Countermeasure Hold-down Timer....... 60    Eap-params.................................... Enabled       EAP-Identity-Request Timeout (seconds)..... 30       EAP-Identity-Request Max Retries........... 2       EAP-Request Timeout (seconds).............. 30       EAP-Request Max Retries.................... 2       EAPOL-Key Timeout (milliseconds)........... 1000       EAPOL-Key Max Retries...................... 0

Note: Implementing the previous workaround may have a negative impact on normal wireless client association to the access point in the following scenarios:

Clients that are slow or may drop initial  processing of EAPoL message number 1 (M1). This is seen on some embedded/CPU-limited clients, which may receive the M1 and not be ready to process it after the 802.1x  authentication phase.
Environments with RF (Radio Frequency) interference or a WAN connection between the access point (AP) and the WLC, which may result in packet drops at some point on transmission towards clients.
  In either scenario the outcome would be an EAPoL exchange failure and the wireless client will lose its authentication, requiring it to restart the association/authentication processes.
Workaround for CVE-2017-13082  For customers who are concerned about CVE-2017-13082 (Accepting a Retransmitted FT Reassociation Request and Reinstalling the Pairwise Key While Processing It), the workaround is as follows:

If no interactive applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or video are being used on the network, you can disable 11r support on the access point.
If VoIP applications are in use but the supplicants support CCKM (for example, Cisco Wireless Phones), you can disable 11r support and reconfigure the clients to use CCKM (Cisco Centralized Key Management), which should provide a similar roaming experience.
  Note: Disabling 11r support may have negative performance and availability impact on the network. Customers should verify that disabling 11r would not negatively impact their environment before performing such configuration change on their infrastructure devices.

No workarounds have been identified for CVE-2017-13086, CVE-2017-13087, or CVE-2017-13088. Any future workarounds that address these vulnerabilities will be documented in the respective Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"].</Description>

  In either scenario the outcome would be an EAPoL exchange failure and the wireless client will lose its authentication, requiring it to restart the association/authentication processes.
Workaround for CVE-2017-13082  For customers who are concerned about CVE-2017-13082 (Accepting a Retransmitted FT Reassociation Request and Reinstalling the Pairwise Key While Processing It), the workaround is as follows:

If no interactive applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or video are being used on the network, you can disable 11r support on the access point.
If VoIP applications are in use but the supplicants support CCKM (for example, Cisco Wireless Phones), you can disable 11r support and reconfigure the clients to use CCKM (Cisco Centralized Key Management), which should provide a similar roaming experience.
  Note: Disabling 11r support may have negative performance and availability impact on the network. Customers should verify that disabling 11r would not negatively impact their environment before performing such configuration change on their infrastructure devices.

No workarounds have been identified for CVE-2017-13086, CVE-2017-13087, or CVE-2017-13088.

        <Description>Workaround for CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13079, CVE-2017-13080, and CVE-2017-13081  Limiting the maximum number of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) over LAN (EAPoL) key retries to 0 has been determined to be a valid workaround for these vulnerabilities. Setting the EAPoL retries value to 0 means one message will be sent, there will be no retransmissions sent, and if the EAPoL timeout is exceeded the client will be removed.

This workaround can be configured at the global level or at the individual wireless LAN (WLAN) level. Please note that the option to configure this workaround at the WLAN level is only available on Cisco WLC releases 7.6 and later. Previous releases only allow configuration at the global (all WLANs) level.

In order to configure this workaround at the global level (for all WLANs), use the following command in the WLC CLI:
config advanced eap eapol-key-retries 0

    The command show advanced eap can be used to verify the configuration change is now active on the device (in bold on the following example output):

(wlc-hostname)&gt; show advanced eap
EAP-Identity-Request Timeout (seconds)........... 30  EAP-Identity-Request Max Retries................. 2  EAP Key-Index for Dynamic WEP.................... 0  EAP Max-Login Ignore Identity Response........... enable  EAP-Request Timeout (seconds).................... 30  EAP-Request Max Retries.......................... 2  EAPOL-Key Timeout (milliseconds)................. 1000  EAPOL-Key Max Retries............................ 0  EAP-Broadcast Key Interval....................... 120

In order to configure this workaround for a specific WLAN, the following two commands should be entered in the WLC CLI:
config wlan security eap-params enable WLAN-NUMBER
config wlan security eap-params eapol-key-retries 0 WLAN-NUMBER
    Both commands must be entered and WLAN-NUMBER should be replaced with the actual WLAN number. In the following example, the workaround is being implemented on WLAN number 24:
config wlan security eap-params enable 24
config wlan security eap-params eapol-key-retries 0 24

The command show wlan WLAN-NUMBER (where WLAN-NUMBER is replaced with the appropriate WLAN number) can be used then to verify the configuration change is now active on the device (in bold on the following example output):
(wlc-hostname)&gt; show wlan 24
WLAN Identifier.................................. X  Profile Name..................................... ftpsk  Network Name (SSID).............................. ftpsk  .  .  .    Tkip MIC Countermeasure Hold-down Timer....... 60    Eap-params.................................... Enabled       EAP-Identity-Request Timeout (seconds)..... 30       EAP-Identity-Request Max Retries........... 2       EAP-Request Timeout (seconds).............. 30       EAP-Request Max Retries.................... 2       EAPOL-Key Timeout (milliseconds)........... 1000       EAPOL-Key Max Retries...................... 0

Note: Implementing the previous workaround may have a negative impact on normal wireless client association to the access point in the following scenarios:

Clients that are slow or may drop initial  processing of EAPoL message number 1 (M1). This is seen on some embedded/CPU-limited clients, which may receive the M1 and not be ready to process it after the 802.1x  authentication phase.
Environments with RF (Radio Frequency) interference or a WAN connection between the access point (AP) and the WLC, which may result in packet drops at some point on transmission towards clients.
  In either scenario the outcome would be an EAPoL exchange failure and the wireless client will lose its authentication, requiring it to restart the association/authentication processes.
Workaround for CVE-2017-13082  For customers who are concerned about CVE-2017-13082 (Accepting a Retransmitted FT Reassociation Request and Reinstalling the Pairwise Key While Processing It), the workaround is as follows:

Please note that the option to configure this workaround at the WLAN level is only available on Cisco WLC releases 7.6 and later. Previous releases only allow configuration at the global (all WLANs) level.

In order to configure this workaround at the global level (for all WLANs), use the following command in the WLC CLI:
config advanced eap eapol-key-retries 0

    The command show advanced eap can be used to verify the configuration change is now active on the device (in bold on the following example output):

(wlc-hostname)&gt; show advanced eap
EAP-Identity-Request Timeout (seconds)........... 30  EAP-Identity-Request Max Retries................. 2  EAP Key-Index for Dynamic WEP.................... 0  EAP Max-Login Ignore Identity Response........... enable  EAP-Request Timeout (seconds).................... 30  EAP-Request Max Retries.......................... 2  EAPOL-Key Timeout (milliseconds)................. 1000  EAPOL-Key Max Retries............................ 0  EAP-Broadcast Key Interval....................... 120

In order to configure this workaround for a specific WLAN, the following two commands should be entered in the WLC CLI:
config wlan security eap-params enable WLAN-NUMBER
config wlan security eap-params eapol-key-retries 0 WLAN-NUMBER
    Both commands must be entered and WLAN-NUMBER should be replaced with the actual WLAN number. In the following example, the workaround is being implemented on WLAN number 24:
config wlan security eap-params enable 24
config wlan security eap-params eapol-key-retries 0 24

The command show wlan WLAN-NUMBER (where WLAN-NUMBER is replaced with the appropriate WLAN number) can be used then to verify the configuration change is now active on the device (in bold on the following example output):
(wlc-hostname)&gt; show wlan 24
WLAN Identifier.................................. X  Profile Name..................................... ftpsk  Network Name (SSID).............................. ftpsk  .  .  .    Tkip MIC Countermeasure Hold-down Timer....... 60    Eap-params.................................... Enabled       EAP-Identity-Request Timeout (seconds)..... 30       EAP-Identity-Request Max Retries........... 2       EAP-Request Timeout (seconds).............. 30       EAP-Request Max Retries.................... 2       EAPOL-Key Timeout (milliseconds)........... 1000       EAPOL-Key Max Retries...................... 0

Note: Implementing the previous workaround may have a negative impact on normal wireless client association to the access point in the following scenarios:

Clients that are slow or may drop initial  processing of EAPoL message number 1 (M1). This is seen on some embedded/CPU-limited clients, which may receive the M1 and not be ready to process it after the 802.1x  authentication phase.
Environments with RF (Radio Frequency) interference or a WAN connection between the access point (AP) and the WLC, which may result in packet drops at some point on transmission towards clients.
  In either scenario the outcome would be an EAPoL exchange failure and the wireless client will lose its authentication, requiring it to restart the association/authentication processes.
Workaround for CVE-2017-13082  For customers who are concerned about CVE-2017-13082 (Accepting a Retransmitted FT Reassociation Request and Reinstalling the Pairwise Key While Processing It), the workaround is as follows:

If no interactive applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or video are being used on the network, you can disable 11r support on the access point.
If VoIP applications are in use but the supplicants support CCKM (for example, Cisco Wireless Phones), you can disable 11r support and reconfigure the clients to use CCKM (Cisco Centralized Key Management), which should provide a similar roaming experience.
  Note: Disabling 11r support may have negative performance and availability impact on the network. Customers should verify that disabling 11r would not negatively impact their environment before performing such configuration change on their infrastructure devices.

No workarounds have been identified for CVE-2017-13086, CVE-2017-13087, or CVE-2017-13088.

    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the processing of the 802.11z (Extensions to Direct-Link Setup) TDLS handshake messages could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to force a supplicant that is compliant with the 802.11z standard to reinstall a previously used TPK key.




The vulnerability is due to ambiguities in the processing of associated protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passively eavesdropping on a TDLS handshake and retransmitting previously used message exchanges between supplicant and authenticator.</Note>
