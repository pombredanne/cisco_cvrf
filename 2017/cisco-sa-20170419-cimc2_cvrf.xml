    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the session identification management functionality of the web-based GUI of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack a valid user session on an affected system.

The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not assign a new session identifier to a user session when a user authenticates to the web-based GUI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a hijacked session identifier to connect to the software through the web-based GUI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated userâ€™s browser session on the affected system.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
