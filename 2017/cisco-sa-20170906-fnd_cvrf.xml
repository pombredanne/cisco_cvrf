    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the TCP throttling process for Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND)   could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the system to consume additional memory, eventually forcing the device to restart.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient rate-limiting protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of TCP packets to a specific group of open listening ports on a targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the system to consume additional memory. If enough available memory is consumed, the system will restart, creating a temporary denial of service (DoS) condition. The DoS condition will end after the device has finished the restart process.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170906-fnd ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170906-fnd"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products:

Connected Grid Network Management System, if running a software release prior to IoT-FND Release 4.0
IoT Field Network Director, if running a software release prior to IoT-FND Release 4.0

Note: Cisco Connected Grid Network Management System and Cisco IoT Field Network Director are the same product. Prior to Release 3.0, this product was named Cisco Connected Grid Network Management System. As of Release 3.0, this product is named Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND).</Note>
    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">If this vulnerability has been exploited, the error log file on the device (/opt/cgms/server/cgms/log/cgms_watchdog.log) could contain the following error messages:
ERROR: IoT-FND application server is not responding. Retry count: 3, Max retry: 3
ERROR: Max retry reached.
INFO: IoT-FND is running. Shutting down IoT-FND ...
INFO: Starting IoT-FND ...
  Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to further determine if the device has been exploited by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Fixed Releases

This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco IoT-FND Release 4.0. This software can be obtained by contacting the Cisco TAC.
  Note: Please refer to the Cisco IoT Field Network Director User Guide ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/connectedgrid/iot_fnd/guide/3_1/iot_fnd_3_1/installation.html"] for additional information.</Note>
