    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco License Manager software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to download and view files within the application which should be restricted.

The issue is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP request parameters that describe filenames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location. An exploit could allow the attacker to view application files which may contain sensitive information.

Cisco has not released and will not release a software update to address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
