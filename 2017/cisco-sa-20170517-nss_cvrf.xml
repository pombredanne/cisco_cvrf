  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS System Software running on Cisco Nexus Series Switches could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a command injection attack.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted command arguments into a vulnerable CLI command. An exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files at the user’s privilege level outside of the user’s path.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
