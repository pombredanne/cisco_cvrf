    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web application interface of the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) portal could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of an affected system.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data that is written to log files and displayed in certain web pages of the web interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by successfully registering to a device and injecting script code as part of a user-supplied value during the registration process. An attacker could convince an administrator to visit an affected page or view an affected log file to exploit the vulnerability. The injected script code would be executed in the affected user's browser within the security context of the affected device.

For additional information about cross-site scripting attacks and the methods used to exploit these vulnerabilities, see the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Threat Vectors ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20060922-understanding-xss"].

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
