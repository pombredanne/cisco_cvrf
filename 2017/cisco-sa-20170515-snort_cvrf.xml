  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Two vulnerabilities in the protocol decoders of Snort++ (Snort 3) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerabilities are due to lack of validation in the protocol decoders. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting a malicious packet and sending it through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition if the Snort process restarts and traffic inspection is bypassed or traffic is dropped.

There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.
