  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web portal of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning (PCP) Tool could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of an affected system.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of a user-supplied value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious JavaScript code to the PCP administrative UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform actions as a higher-level administrator.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
